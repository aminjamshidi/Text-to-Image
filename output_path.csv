0,Animal Farm,"Old Major, the old boar on the Manor Farm, calls the animals on the farm for a meeting. He compares the humans to parasites and teaches the animals a revolutionary song, 'Beasts of England' When Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and turn his dream into a philosophy. They adopt Seven Commandments of Animal-ism, the most important of which is, ""All animals are equal"". Snowball attempts to teach the animals reading and writing; food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health. Napoleon and Snowball struggle for leadership. When Snowball announces his plans to build a windmill, Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader. Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs, who will run the farm. He and the pigs abuse their power, imposing more control while reserving privileges for themselves and rewriting history, villainising Snowball. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were when under Mr Jones. Mr Frederick, one of the neighbouring farmers, uses blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so at great cost, as many, including Boxer the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill and dies in the hands of the best medical care. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon's, explaining that better care can be given there. Squealer and Napoleon indulge in the vices of humans (drinking, sleeping in beds, trading in trading accounts, etc) to alter the account in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about their society and society. Napoleon announces an alliance with the humans, against the labouring classes of both ""worlds"". He abolishes practices and traditions related to the Revolution, and changes the name of the Farm to ""The Manor Farm"" The animals, overhearing the conversation, notice that the faces of the pigs have begun changing. During a poker match, an argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr Pilkington and the animals realise that the Faces of the Pigs look like the facesof humans, and no one can tell the difference between them. The original commandments are: Whatever goes upon two legs, or has wings, is an enemy."
1,A Clockwork Orange,"Alex, a teenager living in near-future England, leads his gang on nightly orgies of opportunistic, random ""ultra-violence"" Alex's friends (""droogs"" in the novel's Anglo-Russian slang, Nadsat) are: Dim, a slow-witted bruiser who is the gang's muscle; Georgie, an ambitious second-in-command; and Pete, who mostly plays along as the droogs indulge their taste for ultra-violence. In a metafictional touch, the husband is a writer working on a manuscript called ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel’s main theme before shredding the manuscript. The writer does not recognize Alex because the gang wore masks during the assault, and does not know Alex is the writer, whose name is revealed as F Alexander. Alex is also intelligent and quick-witting, with sophisticated taste in music, being particularly fond of Beethoven, or ""Lovely Ludwig Van."" Alex skips school the next day. Since his parents are now renting his room to a lodger, Alex wanders the streets and enters a public library where he hopes to learn a painless way to commit suicide. There, he accidentally encounters the old scholar he assaulted earlier in the book who, keen to turn out Alex, beats him up with the help of his friends. The two policemen take Alex outside of the town and beat him up until he collapses at the door of an isolated cottage. During this sequence it is revealed that Mrs Alexander died from the injuries inflicted during the gang-rape, and her husband has decided to continue living in ""where her horrid memory persists"" despite the memories of Alexander. The first half of the story is the first half and his droogs invaded the house and his memories of Mrs Alexander are invaded. The second half is the second half and he realizes that it is too late and he is living in a ""fragrant and horrid"" house. The third half is when he shelters and questions him and shelters him in a shelter and asks him about the memories and questions about the horrid memories he persists in living in. The fourth and final section is when Alex is released into society and he shelters himself in the shelter and questions the memories about him and the memories he continues to live in despite the memory of her. The last half is a tragic pathos, as Alex insists on following through on Georgie's idea to burgle the home of a wealthy old woman."
2,The Plague,"Thousands of rats die in the streets of the town of Oran. Authorities respond by declaring martial law and imposing a curfew. When the daily number of deaths jumps to 30, the town is sealed and an outbreak of plague is officially declared. The plague begins to affect various characters, who begin to feel isolated and introverted. At the end of October, a new anti-plague serum is tried for the first time, but it cannot save the life of the Prefect, M. Othon, who has died of the plague. The text of The Plague is divided into five parts: the first, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth. The book is published by Picador, priced at $24.99, and is available in English, French, Spanish and Italian. It was published in France in 1864. It is published in the UK by Macmillan Books, priced £16.99 (pensioners) and £20 (non-fomers). It is also available in the U.S. for £15.99 and £18.99. It has been translated into English as ""The Plague: A Tale of the Black Death"" and ""The Black Death: A Biography of The Black Death"", published by MacMillan Books in 1998. The French version of the book has a different ending, with the ending being changed from ""the black death"" to ""the white plague"" The book was written in 1868 and published in 1869. It includes a prologue, the first part of which is written by Dr. Bernard Rieux, and the second part is by Jean Tarrou. The story is about a doctor and a civil servant who try to stop a plague outbreak in their town. It also includes the story of a man who tries to escape the city to join his lover in Paris, but is forced to stay after he is caught in the plague's clutches. In the last part of the novel, the main character, Dr. Cottard, tries to attend a performance of Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice, but collapses with plague symptoms during the performance. He decides to stay, saying he would feel ashamed of himself if he left. The novel ends on a note of hope, as the plague seems to seem to be going away, but in fact it has spread to other parts of the world. It ends with a cliffhanger, ending on a promise of a cure."
3,An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,"The argument of the Enquiry proceeds by a series of incremental steps, separated into chapters which logically succeed one another. After expounding his epistemology, Hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics. For Hume, philosophy can be split into two general parts: natural philosophy and the philosophy of human nature (or, as he calls it, ""moral philosophy"") The latter investigates both actions and thoughts, while the former investigates both thoughts and ideas. In the first part, Hume discusses how the objects of inquiry are either ""relations of ideas"" or ""matters of fact"", which is roughly the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions. In part two, Hume inquires into how anyone can justifiably believe that experience yields any conclusions about the world. Here he is describing what would become known as the problem of induction. For us, Hume shows that experience tells us something about world because of human habit, which forces us to assume something about human nature because of habit. He also explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas: resemblance, contiguity in space-time, and cause-and-effect. He argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas. (Hume 1974:322) In explaining how matters of fact are entirely a product of experience, he dismisses the notion that they may be arrived at through a priori reasoning. In this chapter, he explains how thoughts tend to come in sequences, as in trains of thought. For example, the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression (or sensation) of actually eating one. He explains how a circular argument for the validity of experience can be based neither on demonstration (since it implies that the course of nature may change) nor on the fact that experience would be a contradiction that would be circular. But in one word, he answers the question, What is the foundation of all reasonings concerning that matter of fact? He says that it is founded on the relation of cause and effect, and it is replied, it is on relation of effect and relation to experience. In a later chapter, Hume also mentions the operations of mixing, separating, and dividing. He concludes by stating that one may experience a novel idea that itself is derived from combinations of previous impressions, such as with the body of a man upon a horse to make a centaur; augmenting (as with the case of a giant, whose size has been augmented); and diminishing."
4,A Fire Upon the Deep,"The novel posits that space around the Milky Way is divided into concentric layers called Zones, each being constrained by different laws of physics. The outermost zone, the ""Transcend"", contains most of the galactic halo and is populated by incomprehensibly vast and powerful posthuman entities. A human expedition investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches for the ambitious young civilization of the Straumli Realm. The expedition's facility, called High Lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant super-intelligent entity (actually encoded within the archive) later known as the Blight. The novel starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of this superintelligence through exponentially accelerating developmental stages, culminating in a transcendent, nigh-omnipotent power that is unfathomable to mere humans. It ends with Pham Nuwen extending the Slow Zone by thousands of light-years to enclose the threat of the Bllight, at the cost of thousands of uninvolved civilizations and potentially the extinction of several galactic races. It also strands Pham and the other humans on the Tines world, now in the depths of the ""Slow Zone"" where rescue by an advanced civilization is impossible. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book versions for $24.99 (with an MSRP of $25).

5,All Quiet on the Western Front,"The book tells the story of Paul Bäumer, a German soldier who joins the German army shortly after the start of World War I. The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of artillery fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits and the role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail. In the final chapter, Paul feels that that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining. When he finally dies at the end of the novel, ""All Quiet on the Western Front,"" states the situation, ""The symbolizing the cheapness of human life in war is the soldier"" He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war. They are then sent on what Paul calls a ""good job"" They must guard a village that is being shelled too heavily. The men enjoy themselves but while evacuating the villagers, Paul and Albert are wounded. They recuperate in a Catholic hospital and Paul returns to active duty. By now, the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. He feels that he has no aims left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood. ""We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces,"" he says. ""Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you? Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it."" In the end, he concludes that he ""ought never to have come [home] on leave."" Paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He finds that he does ""not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world"""
6,A Wizard of Earthsea,"Ged is a young boy on Gont, one of the larger islands in the north of the archipelago of Earthsea. Ged discovers by accident that he has an extraordinary talent for magic. His aunt, the village witch, teaches him the little she herself knows, but his power far exceeds hers. In the rite of passage into adulthood, he gives the boy his ""true name"", Ged, and takes him as an apprentice. In his hubris, he attempts to summon a dead spirit - a perilous spell which goes awry. The shadow seizes the chance to escape into the world and attacks him, scarring his face. He flees to what appears to be a safe haven in the castle of Benderesk, the lord of Terranon. Serret, his wife, is the same girl who taunted Ged years ago. She tries to enslave Ged using the power of a stone which harbors one ofThe ""Nameless Ones"", ancient malevolent powers that predate the world. Fortunately Ged flies away in the form of a falcon and returns to Gont and Ogion to turn the tables on his enemy. In following the shadow, Ged pursues the shadowwards across the ocean, but nearly drowned when the boat lures him into his boat onto rocks, but he manages to reach a small island inhabited by only two old people, a Kargish man and his sister. Despite their initial fear of him, they provide him with food and water and he regains his strength. He is finally able to reach the safety of Roke, where he is reunited with his sister, who were abandoned as children and have forgotten there is an outside world outside of their world. He eventually realizes that he cannot both defend the islanders against the dragon and himself against the nameless thing he summoned. He takes a desperate gamble; in the old histories, he has found the true name of a dragon which might be the one he faces. His guess is right and by using the dragon's name, Yevaud, he is able to force the dragon to vow that neither it nor its offspring will ever trouble the islander. After a painful and slow recovery, he graduates from the school. He returns to the people of Gont to help them in their fight against a powerful dragon and its maturing sons, who have been seen scouting the region. He realizes that the roles of Ged and the enemy become reversed and the roles are reversed."

10,Book of Joshua,"Joshua is a book about the conquest of the Promised Land. God commissions Joshua to take possession of the land and warns him to keep faith with the Covenant. The Israelites cross the Jordan through the miraculous intervention of God and his ark and are circumcised at Gibeath-Haaraloth (translated as hill of foreskins) The conquest begins in Canaan with Jericho, followed by Ai (central Canaan) and renews the Covenant (the covenant ceremony has elements of a divine land-grant ceremony, similar to ceremonies known from Mesopotamia). The narrative now switches to the south. With the south conquered the narrative moves to the northern campaign. A powerful multi-national coalition headed by the king of Hazor, the most important northern city, is defeated with Yahweh's help and Hazor captured and destroyed. The Gibeonites trick the Israelites into entering into an alliance with them by saying they are not Canaanites, but they are enslaved instead. Joshua performs the concluding covenant ceremony, and send the people to their inheritance. Chapter 11:16-23 summarises the campaign: Joshua has taken the entire land, and the land ""had rest from war"" Chapter 12 lists the vanquished kings on both sides of the Jordan. The Transjordanian tribes are dismissed, affirming their loyalty to YahweH. Joshua charges the leaders of the Israelite leaders to remain faithful to Yah Weh and the covenant, warning of judgement should Israel leave Yahwe H and follow other gods. The story now turns to the second, to ""put the people in possession ofThe second, is a ""covenantal land grant"": Yahwe h, as king, is issuing each tribe its territory. The ""cities of refuge"" and Levitical cities are attached to the end, since it is necessary for the tribes to receive their grants before they allocate parts of it to others. The tribes are given their grants first, and then the land is given to them in a series of stages, with the final stage being the land grant. The book ends with a speech by Joshua about what must be done if Israel is to live in peace in the land. It may have used the then-recent 701&nbsp;BCE campaign of the Assyrian king Sennacherib in Judah as his model; the hanging of the captured kings is in accordance with Assyrian practice of the 8th century. It is possible that the Deuteronomist author may have been inspired by this campaign."

12,Book of Numbers,"God orders Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, to number those able to bear arms and to appoint princes over each tribe. 603,550 Israelites are found to be fit for military service. Miriam and Aaron insult Moses at Hazeroth, which angers God; Miriam is punished with leprosy and is shut out of camp for seven days. The Israelites blame Moses for the lack of water. Moses is ordered by God to speak to a rock but disobeys, and is punished by the announcement that he shall not enter Canaan. The children of Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron on account of the death of Korah's men and are stricken with the plague, with 14,700 perishing. The Levites are again appointed to help in the keeping of the Tabernacle. The land east of the Jordan is divided among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Moses orders the Israelites to massacre the people of Midian. The boundaries of the land are spelled out to be divided under the supervision of Eleazar, Joshua, and twelve princes. The daughters of Zelophehad, their father having no sons, are to share in the allotment. The Reubenites and the Gadites request Moses to assign them the land eastof the Jordan. Moses grants their request after they promise to help with the conquest of theLand west of theJordan. The Land is divided by lot, with the daughters of the father of one of the Reubenite princes to share the allotments. A new census gives the total number of males from twenty years and upward as 601,730. The number of the Levites from a month old and upward is 23,000. The Lord orders a second census, in which the tribe of Levi is exempted from military service and therefore not included in the census totals. The people of Israel are bitten by Fiery flying serpents for speaking against God and Moses, and a brazen serpent is made to ward off these serpent. The God-fearing Israelites set out for Moab, on Canaan's western border, on the plains of Moab. They are told that the land is abundant and is ""flowing with milk and honey""; the other spies say that it is inhabited by giants, and they refuse to enter the land. Moses recalls the stations at which the. Israelites halted during their years' wander during their forty years of wander."
13,Book of Ruth,"During the Judges, an Israelite family from Bethlehem emigrate to the nearby country of Moab. Elimelech dies, and the sons marry two Moabite women: Mahlon marries Ruth and Chilion marries Orpah. The two sons of Naomi then die themselves. Naomi tells her daughters-in-law to return to their own mothers, and remarry. However, Ruth says, ""Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following you"" (Ruth 1:16–17 NKJV) Boaz and Ruth get married and have a son named Obed (who by Levirate customs is also considered a son or heir to Elimeslech, and thus Naomi). In the genealogy which concludes the story, it is pointed out that Obed is the father of Jesse, and Thus the grandfather of David. This also places Ruth among David's ancestors. (R Ruth 4:7–18) Boz and Ruth have a child named Obing. (Obed is the grandfather to Jesse and thus David) (Ezekiel 16:8) (N.B. The phrase ""spread your cloak"" was a woman's way of asking for marriage. For a man to spread his cloak over a woman showed acquisition of that woman. For Ruth to ""uncover the feet"" of the sleeping Boaz, Ruth does so; Boaz awakes and asks,""Who are you?"" Ruth identifies herself, then asks Boaz to spread her cloak over her. The next morning, Boaz discusses the issue with the other male relative, Ploni Almoni (""so-and-so"") before the town elders. The other relative is unwilling to jeopardize the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth, and so relinquishes his right of redemption. They transfer the property and redeem it by the nearer kinsman taking off his sandal and handing it over to Boaz. (Boaz 4:6–7) (NKJV) (Runk 4:8-9) (KJV) Ruth and Boaz get married. (KV: 4:9-10) ( NK: 9-10). (Kv: 10-11) (J:11-12) (kv: 11-13) ( Kv: 13-14) (kj: 14-15) ( kv: 15-16) (j:15-17) (qv: 17-18) (kk: 18-19)"
14,Book of Esther,"Ahasuerus, ruler of a massive Persian empire, holds a lavish party, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards for all inhabitants of the capital city Shushan. He orders the queen Vashti to display her beauty before the guests, but she refuses. Worried all women will learn from this, he removes her as queen and has a royal decree sent across the empire that men should be the ruler of their households. One of these is the orphan Esther, whose Jewish name is Hadassah. She finds favor in the king's eyes, and is made his new queen. Esther does not reveal that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her. The previous decree against the Jews cannot be annulled, but the king allows the Jews to defend themselves during attacks on 13 Adar. As a result, five hundred attackers and Haman's ten sons are killed in ShUSHan, followed by a Jewish slaughter of seventy-five thousand Persians, although they took no plunder. Ahasueru remains very powerful and continues with his prominent position in the court, with Mordechai assuming a prominent position with his position in his court, and continues to rule with a prominent role. The story ends on the 13th of the month of Adar, when everyone in the empire is free to massacre the Jews and despoil their property, and the Jews are massacred by Haman and his friends. The book was first published in 7th century BC by Boudicca and is now considered one of the most important works of ancient Persian literature. It is also known as the ""Book of the Kings"" and ""The Book of the Lost Kings"" by H.A. Ghandi and H. A. Hellyer. It was written by Terence Moore and published by Macmillan & Co. in 18th century. The novel is about the downfall of the Persian king and his prime minister, Haman. The plot involves the assassination of the king and the death of the prime minister's son and heir to the throne, the son of Haman, Mordecai, and his son-in-law, the king, Ahasurus. It also tells the story of the birth of the first woman to rule the Persian Empire, the first Persian queen, and how she became a mother to Esther, the daughter of Ahaserus and the mother of the next king, Qutb."
15,Book of Job,"The book of Job tells the story of an extremely righteous man named Job, who is very prosperous and has seven sons and three daughters. Constantly fearing that his sons may have sinned and ""cursed God in their hearts"", he habitually offers burnt offerings as a pardon for their sins. The ""sons of God"" and Satan (literally ""the Adversary"") present themselves to God, and God asks Satan his opinion on Job. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has put a ""wall around"" him and ""blessed"" his favourite servant with prosperity, but if God were to stretch out his hand and strike everything that Job had, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to test Job's righteousness. All Job's possessions are destroyed: 500 yoke of oxen and 500 donkeys carried off by Sabeans; 7,000 sheep burned up by 'The fire of God which fell from the sky'; 3,000 camels stolen by the Chaldeans; and the house of the firstborn destroyed by a mighty wind, killing Job's ten children. Still Job does not curse God, but instead shaves his head, tears his clothes, and says, ""Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: Lord has given, and Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of Lord"" The story ends with Job restored to health, with a new family and twice as much livestock, and Job's wife prompts him to ""curse God"" But Job answers, ""You speak as one of the foolish speaks. Moreover, shall we receive good from God and shall not receive evil?"" Three friends of Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, come to console him. The friends spend seven days sitting on the ground with Job, without saying anything to him because they see that he is suffering and in much pain. Job at last breaks his silence and ""Curses the day he was born"" God responds saying that there are so many things Job doesnot know about how this world was formed or how nature works, that Job should consider God as being greater than the thunderstorm and strong enough to pull in the leviathan with a fish-hook. God then rebukes the three friends and says: ""I am angry with you... you have not spoken of me what is right"""
16,Book of Hosea,"Hosea was directed by God to marry a promiscuous woman of ill-repute, and he did so. Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant. Hosea and his wife, Gomer, have a son. The naming of this son was to stand as a prophecy against the reigning house of the Northern Kingdom, that they would pay for that bloodshed. Third, the couple have a daughter. God commands that she be named Lo-ruhamah; Unloved, or, Pity or Pitied On to show Israel that, although God will still have pity on the Southern Kingdom, God will no longer have pity for them. Fourth, a son is born to Gomer. The child bore this name of shame to show that the Northern. Kingdom would also be shamed, for its people would no longer be known as God's. People. God says that ""I am not your I am""; in other words, God changes His own name in connection with his current relationship with Israel. God will one day renew the covenant, and will take Israel back in love. God promises not entirely to give them entirely up, in part of which part of the prophet pleads for Israel's repentance. Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of Assyria, because there has been no repentance. In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging its fidelity to God. All the members of the upper classes and many ordinary people were taken and carried off as prisoners of war. Joseph, Mary, and the infant Jesus of Egypt, were taken to Egypt and returned to Israel of Egypt. The capital of the northern Kingdom, in 722 BC, in the capital of Jerusalem, was the city of Ephraim. The city was the birthplace of Jesus, and many of the ordinary people who were taken there to live as slaves. The people of the north were taken off as captives and carried away as war prisoners. This is where the story of the birth of Jesus and the return to Egypt of Joseph of Egypt of Mary of Egypt and the flight into Egypt of the infant Christ of Egypt is told. This story is possibly a marriage to different women * Chapters 4-14:9; Oracle judging Israel, EphRAim in particular, for not living up to the covenant of God. No further breakdown of ideas is clear in 4- 14:9."
17,Book of Jonah,"God calls Jonah to proclaim judgment to Nineveh, but Jonah resists and attempts to flee. God calls up a great storm at sea, and the ship's crew cast Jonah overboard in an attempt to appease God. A great sea creature sent by God, swallows Jonah. For three days and three nights Jonah languishes inside the fish's belly. He says a prayer in which he repents for his disobedience and thanks God for His mercy. After his rescue, Jonah obeys the call to prophesy against Nineveh and they repent and God forgives them. Ironically, the relentless God demonstrated in the first chapter becomes the merciful God in the last two chapters (see 3:10). In a parallel turnabout, Jonah becomes one of the most effective of all prophets, turning the entire population of Nineveh (about 120,000 people) to God. The book was written by H.P. Lovecraft and is published by Simon & Schuster at a cost of £16.99 per book. The first edition of the book was published in London in 1844. The second edition was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1847. The third edition was released in 1849. The fourth edition was printed in 1852. The last edition was issued in 1853. The fifth and sixth editions were published in 1854 and 1855. The sixth edition was also published in New York and Paris, but the final edition was not published in the United States until 1856. The seventh and eighth editions have been published in Paris and New York. The ninth and tenth editions were released in Jerusalem and Jerusalem, respectively, in 1856 and 1857. The eighth and ninth editions of the Bible have been released in London and Jerusalem. The tenth and final edition is published in Jerusalem in 1858 and 1859. The eleventh and final volume is entitled ""The Book of the Law"" and the tenth is called ""The Law and the Prophets"" The last two volumes are published in Egypt and Syria, and are titled ""The Story of Jonah"" and ""The Power and the Power of God"" The first two chapters are about Jonah's journey from Joppa to Tarshish, where he is rescued by a fish. In the second chapter, Jonah tells God that it would be better if he were dead. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. The next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, withering it, and he tells God he would prefer to be dead."
18,Book of Micah,"Samaria and Jerusalem are given prominence as the foci of the prophet’s attention. Paronomasia is a literary device which 'plays' on the sound of each word for literary effect. Micah describes the destruction of the lesser towns of Judah (referring to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib, 701&nbsp;BC. Despite their trials, God will not desert his people. Assyria will be stricken, and Israel's punishment will lead to the punishment of the nations. Israel's rulers are accused of gaining more wealth at the expense of the poor, by any means. Jerusalem's rulers believe that God will always be with them, but God will be with his people, and Jerusalem will be destroyed. Zion will be rebuilt, but by God, and based not on violence and corruption but on the desire to learn God's laws and live in peace. Although chapters 4:9-10 have said that there is ""no king in Zion"", these chapters predict a new military ruler will emerge from Bethlehem, the traditional home of the Davidic monarchy, to restore the security of Israel. The city of Cheat is reprimanded for its dishonest trade practices, and declares that animals and humans should be burnt in the same way as the animals. The City of God is not necessary for God, but for justice and Kindness, and to Walk Humbly with God. The people of Judah accuse Israel of breaking the covenant through their lack of honesty, after the pattern of the kings of Israel (northern kingdom) Micah speaks on behalf of the community asking what they should do in order to get back on God's good side. The first city is condemned as a Cheat, and the city is then reprimanded by Micah. The second city is also reprimanded, and it is declared that the offering of animals is not needed for God's love, but that it is better to offer the animals to God in the form of a sacrifice. This is the first time that a city has been condemned for its trade practices. This may have been practiced in Judah under Kings Ahaz and Manasseh, which may have occurred in the time of Ahaz. The cities of Judah are condemned for their idolatry and the abuse of thepoor, and they are told to ‘roll yourselves in the dust’ 1:14. The inhabitants of Beth-le-aphrah (“house of dust”) are told, ‘Roll yourselves in. the dust.” 1:15."
19,Book of Haggai,"Haggai's message is filled with an urgency for the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the second Jerusalem temple. Haggai attributes a recent drought to the peoples' refusal to rebuild the temple, which he sees as key to Jerusalem’s glory. The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, as the Lord's chosen leader. The language here is not as finely wrought as in some other books of the minor prophets, yet the intent seems straightforward. It was written in the first century BC, and is one of the oldest books in the Bible. It is written in Aramaic, which is the language of the ancient Israelites, and was written after the fall of the Babylonian Empire in the second century. It has been translated into English by several different authors, including Samuel Johnson, who wrote the first edition of the Bible, as well as the second edition, which was published in the 17th century and is published by Simon & Schuster. The first edition was written by Samuel Johnson and published in 1776, and the second by Simon and Schuster, who published it in 1799 and 1799. The third edition has been published by Macmillan, which has published the third edition in the 18th century."
20,Crash,"The story is told through the eyes of narrator James Ballard, named after the author himself. It centers on the sinister figure of Dr. Robert Vaughan, a “former TV-scientist, turned nightmare angel of the expressways” Ballard meets Vaughan after being involved in a car accident himself near London Airport. Gathering around Vaughan is a group of alienated people, all of them former crash-victims, who follow him in his pursuit to re-enact the crashes of celebrities, and experience what the narrator calls ""a new sexuality, born from a perverse technology"" Vaughan’s ultimate fantasy is to die in a head-on collision with movie star Elizabeth Taylor.

22,"Candide, ou l'Optimisme","Candide contains thirty episodic chapters, which may be grouped into two main schemes: one consists of two divisions, separated by the protagonist's hiatus in El Dorado; the other consists of three parts, each defined by its geographical setting. By the former scheme, the first half of Candide constitutes the rising action and the last part the resolution. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and picaresque novels, which tend to employ such a dramatic structure. The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761. Candide begins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh in Westphalia, home to the Baron's daughter, Lady Cunégonde; his bastard nephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; a chambermaid, Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. The protagonist is romantically attracted to Cunéegonde, but is evicted from the castle for kissing her. He is captured by Bulgar (Prussian) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is flogged, nearly executed, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the Abares (an allegory representing the Prussians and the French) Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he was given aid by Jacques, an Anabaptist, who strengthens Candide's optimism. He and Jacques set sail to Lisbon, where they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard. The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pang Loss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Along the way, Cuneegonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her. She sells her life to a Jewish merchant who was threatened by a corrupt Grand Inquisitor. Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and both Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas, which included a tragic life which included her own tragic death. He waits alive for an old woman, who had been raped and disemboweled, but she tells him that she had been saved by Candide. He then kills her."
23,Chapterhouse Dune,"The Bene Gesserit are the targets of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and developed methods of the Bene GESSerit and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Mother Superior Darwi Odrade continues to develop her drastic, secret plan to overcome the Matres. In the midst of this battle, the Jews (including Rebecca with her precious memories) take refuge with the Bene Tleilaxu fleet under the cover of diplomacy. Victory for the Bene. Gessers seems inevitable. But in the end, all is not as it seems and they are forced to fight for their lives against a force that is even more powerful than they were previously thought to be.

24,Carmilla,"The story is presented by Le Fanu as part of the casebook of Dr Hesselius, whose departures from medical orthodoxy rank him as the first occult doctor in literature. The story is narrated by Laura, one of the two main protagonists of the tale. Laura begins her tale by relating her childhood in a ""picturesque and solitary"" castle in the midst of an extensive forest in Styria. When she is six years old, Laura has a vision of a beautiful visitor in her bedchamber. She later claims to have been bitten on the chest, although no wounds are found on her. 12 years later, Laura and her father are admiring the sunset in front of the castle when her father tells her of a letter he received earlier from his friend General Spielsdorf. The General was supposed to bring his niece, Bertha Rheinfeldt, to visit the two, but the niece suddenly died under mysterious circumstances. Laura is saddened by the loss of a potential friend, and longs for a companion. A carriage accident outside Laura's home unexpectedly brings a girl of Laura's age into the family's care. Her name is Carmilla. Both girls instantly recognize the other from the 'dream' they both had when they were young. Carmilla and Laura grow to be very close friends, but occasionally Carmilla's mood abruptly changes. She sometimes makes unsettling romantic advances towards Laura. When a shipment of family heirloom restored portraits arrives at the castle, Laura finds one of her ancestors, ""Mircalla, Countess Karnstein"", dated 1698. The portrait resembles Carmilla exactly, down to the mole on her neck. When they arrive at Karnstein, the General asks a nearby woodsman where he can find the tomb of Mircalla. The woodsman relates that the tomb was relocated for the original name of the Countess. While Laura and Carmilla are left alone in the ruined chapel, Carmilla appears to both fly into a rage upon seeing each other and attacks each other with an axe. The two girls are separated by the General and the General explains to Laura that Carmilla is also an original Countess of Karnstein and that she is also a vampire. Laura comments that this information seems needless to say, and her dad laughs it off. Laura's father then sets out with Laura in a carriage for the ruined village of Karn Stein. They leave a message behind asking Carmilla to follow after once the perpetually late-sleeping Carmilla wakes up."

Paul is aware of this fact, but has foreseen that the birth of his heir will bring Chani's death, and does not want to lose her. The conspirators hope the presence of Hayt will undermine Paul's ability to rule by forcing Paul to question himself and the empire he has created. Paul's reaction to Hayt's programming triggers it to kill Paul, but rather than kill his beloved Paul, Duncan's body reacts against its own programming and recovers its full consciousness. He remains conscious of the Zen-Sunni and attempts to come into his sister Alia's and Paul's newborn twins into the world, but is no longer bound to their programming.

30,Darwin's Dangerous Idea,"Darwin's Dangerous Idea is a book by Daniel Dennett. Dennett argues that natural selection is a mindless, mechanical and algorithmic process. He argues that the orderly world we know is the result of a blind and undirected shuffle through chaos. Part I of the book gets its name from a quote by Willard Van Orman Quine: ""Analyze theory-building how we will, we all must start in the middle"" Part II is about the evolution of brains, minds and language. In the last chapter of part I, Dennett treats human artifacts and culture as a branch of a unified Design Space. The penultimate chapter, entitled ""Redesigning Morality"", begins by asking if ethics can be 'naturalized' Dennett does not believe there is much hope of discovering an algorithm for doing the right thing, but expresses optimism in our ability to redesign our approach to moral problems. He concludes that an evolutionary analysis of ethics makes sense, though he cautions against some varieties of 'greedy reductionism' In the book's last chapter, he praises sociobiology, including biodiversity, including cultural diversity, including the ""cranes of culture"" Dennett calls Thomas Hobbes ""the first sociologist"" and Friedrich Nietzsche the ""first sociobiobiologist"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99, with a print run of 1,500 copies.

Moses and Aaron are told to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the Ten Commandments (the Ethical Decalogue) in the hearing of all Israel. God destroys the Egyptian army at the crossing of the Red Sea (Yam Suf) The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where God asks whether they will agree to be his people. Moses comes down the mountain and writes down God's words and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain to receive a set of stone tablets containing the law. God gives Moses instructions for the construction of the tabernacle so that God could dwell there permanently among his chosen people. God makes a golden calf, which Moses tells the people to worship. God threatens to kill them when Moses relents and relents when Aaron was appointed as the first high priest, with the priesthood to be hereditary in his line. God tells them to mark their doorposts with the blood of a sacrificed lamb to indicate that they would be ""passed over"" by this plague, hence this has become the Jewish holiday of Passover. The people gather at the foot of the mountain, and with thunder and lightning, fire and clouds of smoke, and the sound of trumpets, the people see the cloud and hear the voice [or possibly ""sound""] of God. God promises Canaan to them if they obey. Yahweh causes a series of ten plagues to strike Egypt, but whenever Pharaoh begins to relent God causes him to harden his heart. Egypt is plagued by painful boils that cover their bodies. Locusts swarm Egypt and eat any remaining crops and food. Gnats or lice invade Egyptian homes and plague the Egyptian people. The firstborn of every Egyptian family is killed. All the fish die and water becomes undrinkable. The Egyptians are plagued by disease and pestilence, and their livestock are struck down with disease and disease. The Egyptian people are plagued with locusts and lice and gnats, which kill their livestock and destroy their crops and crops. The Egyptians are struck with a plague of boils that covers their bodies and turns their water into blood. The plague kills the Egyptian firstborn."

Montag tries to tell his wife that she overdosed, but is interrupted by Mildred's ramblings of her stomach hurting, but being hungry, and rationalizes that the feeling is from drinking too much alcohol during a party.

36,Farmer Giles of Ham,"Farmer Giles (Ægidius Ahenobarbus Julius Agricola de Hammo, ""Giles Bronze-beard Julius Farmer of Ham"") is not a hero. He is fat and red-bearded and enjoys a slow, comfortable life. But a rather deaf and short-sighted giant blunders on to his land. Giles manages to ward him away with a blunderbuss shot in his general direction. His reputation spreads across the kingdom, and he is rewarded by the King with a sword named Caudimordax (""Tailbiter"") This turns out to be a powerful weapon against dragons. The story parodies the great dragon-slaying traditions. The only part of a 'dragon' they know is the annual celebratory dragon-tail cake.

37,Gaudy Night,"Harriet Vane returns reluctantly to Oxford to attend the Gaudy dinner. She is surprised to be welcomed warmly by the dons, and rediscovers her old love of the academic life. Some time later the Warden of Shrewsbury writes to ask for help. There has been an outbreak of anonymous letters, vandalism and threats, apparently from someone within the college, and a scandal is feared. Harriet is forced to examine her ambivalent feelings about love and marriage, along with her attraction to academia as an intellectual (and emotional) refuge. Her personal dilemma becomes entangled with darkly hinted suspicions and prejudices raised by the crimes at the college. The perpetrator is finally unmasked as one of the college servants, revealed to be the widow of a disgraced academic at a northern university. Her husband's academic fraud had been exposed by one of his fellow dons there, destroying his career and driving him to suicide. The campaign has been the widow's revenge against intellectual women who move outside their ""proper"" domestic sphere. At the end of the book, Harriet Vane finally accepts Wimsey's proposal of marriage. (Their marriage and honeymoon,interrupted by another murder mystery, are depicted in Busman's Honeymoon.) The book was written in 1875.

38,Gylfaginning,"The Gylfaginning tells the story of Gylfi, a king of ""the land that men now call Sweden"", who after being tricked by one of the goddesses of the Æsir wonders if all ÆSir use magic and tricks for their will to be done. This is why he journeys to Asgard, but on the way he is tricked by the gods and arrives in some other place, where he finds a great palace. In the end all the palace and its people just vanish andGylfi is left standing on empty ground. It can be argued that Snorri used this narrative device as a means of being able to safely document a vanishing and largely oral tradition within a Christian context. It is then implied that as Gylf i returns to his nation, he retells the tales he was told. The story ends with the king of the palace saying that he will return to his people. The tale is told in the form of a short poem called ""Gangleri"" which is written in the style of a sonnet. The poem is about a king named Gangleri and his quest to find out the truth about the gods. It was written by the Norwegian poet Snorre associated with the ""Norse sagas"" and is one of his most famous works, along with ""The Book of the Dead"" and ""The Birth of the Gods"" The story is about the creation and destruction of the world (R Ragnarök) and also the creation of the gods (Ragnarök), and how the world was created and destroyed by the Norse gods. The book is also about how the gods created the world, and how they created the Earth and the universe. It ends with a story about a man named High, who is asked to show his wisdom by asking questions by a group of men. High, Just-As-High, and Third are then challenged to show their wisdom by answering these questions. Each question made to High is about an aspect of the Norse mythology or its gods, and also about the Creation and Destruction of the World. The questions are then answered by the men, as is the custom in many Norse sagas. The end of the story shows that the three men have been challenged to give their wisdom to the king, and that the king has accepted their answers. The king then says that he is going back to his country to tell his people the tale he has been told."
39,God Emperor of Dune,"God Emperor Leto II has ruled his Empire for more than 3,500 years. He has merged his human body with sandtrout, the haploid phase of the giant sandworms of Arrakis. His brain has gradually diffused into the rest of his body, becoming a series of nodes throughout his whole form. Leto has enforced a state of peace throughout his empire, both through tight control of his enormous (but limited) hoard of the spice melange and the military might of his Fish Speaker army. His reign is considered by many to be depraved and despotic, but he is confident that his actions will ensure the survival of the human race. As his father before him, Leto is utterly incapable of foreseeing his own demise, and concludes that whatever he cannot see and perceive and thus control &mdash; is connected to his eventual death; ironically, this amuses him since it is one of the few things that still brings surprise to his otherwise dull existence. He himself battles an incessant struggle with boredom and loneliness that overwhelms him because of his everlasting life, close-to-absolute prescience, a loss of vulnerability which renders him incapable of physical intimacy, and his perception of the passage of time in great lengths (as decades may pass without him realizing it). Few people realize the burden that he carries as he deems subjects useful as long as they serve a purpose to the ""Golden Path"" (the end justifying the means). Leto maintains a small and reclusive system of government, and as God, he chooses not to share the inner workings and purpose of his decisions or any sympathy for his cause, as he knows that humanity would not be able to grasp the concept. The Bene Gesserit and Spacing Guild have endured, although both have been forced to adapt to Leto's absolute control over melange. Over the centuries, a significant number of the gholas have attempted to assassinate Leto through various means after struggling with the conflict between their intense loyalty to House Atreides, and the moral disgust triggered by the repression and stagnation Lete has forced upon the Empire. The old Imperium is basically non-existent; the Landsraad has ceased to exist, and only a few remnants of the Great Houses survive. The vast majority of these ghola are made under Leto’s instructions of preserving the original Idaho without enhancements. They remind Leto of his family, and he feels that he owes Duncan for his service and devotion to House atreides."
40,Genesis,"God creates the world in six days and consecrates the seventh after giving mankind his first commandment: ""be fruitful and multiply"" God pronounces the world ""very good"", but it becomes corrupted by the sin of man and God sends a deluge (a great flood) to destroy it, saving only the righteous (Noah) and his family, from whose seed the world is repopulated. Man sins again, but God has promised that he will not destroy the world a second time with water. God instructs Abram (the future Abraham) to travel from his home in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) to the land of Canaan. There God makes a covenant with Abram promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars in the heavens, but that they shall suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years. After which they shall inherit the land ""from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates"" Abram's name is changed to Abraham and that of his wife Sarai to Sarah, and circumcision of all males is instituted as the sign of the covenant. Sarah is barren, and tells Abraham to take her Egyptian handmaiden, Hagar, as a concubine. Through Hagar Abraham becomes the father of Ishmael. Abraham asks God that Ishmaal ""might live in Thy sight,"" (that is, be favored), but God replies that Sarah will bear a son, who will be named Isaac, through whom the covenant will be established. Isaac prays to God and she gives birth to the twins Esau, father of the Edomites, and Jacob. Through deception, Jacob becomes the heir instead of Esau and gains his father's blessing. He flees to his uncle where he prospers and earns his two wives. By his wives Rachel and Leah and their handmaidens he has twelve sons, the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel. Joseph, Jacob's favourite son, is sold into slavery in Egypt by his jealous brothers. But Joseph prospered, and when famine comes he brings his father and his brothers and their households, seventy persons in all, to Egypt, where Pharaoh assigns to them theLand of Goshen. Joseph lives to see his great-grandchildren, and on his death-bed he exhorts his brethren, if God should remember them and lead them out of the country, to take his bones with them. The book ends with Joseph's remains being ""put in a coffin in Egypt."""
41,Gone with the Wind,"Gone with the Wind takes place in the southern United States in the state of Georgia during the American Civil War (1861–1865) and the Reconstruction Era (1865–1877) that followed the war. The novel unfolds against the backdrop of rebellion wherein seven southern states, Georgia among them, have declared their secession from the United States. There are brief but vivid descriptions of the South as it began and grew, with backgrounds of the main characters: the stylish and highbrow French, the gentlemanly English, the forced-to-flee and looked-down-upon Irish. It is clear things have drastically changed: Gerald has lost his mind, Scarlett's mother is dead, and Rhett has a change of heart and he abandons Scarlett to enlist in the army. Part of the novel is based on a true story, but the author has made no changes to the plot or any of the characters' names. The book is available in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Spanish and Native American, with an English-speaking version available in the U.S. and a German-language version in the UK and an American-speaking edition in the US. It was published in 1864 and has sold more than one million copies. It has been hailed as one of the best books of the 20th century, along with Gone With the Wind and Gone With The Wind: The Other Side of the Wind, by Ernest Hemingway, published by Simon & Schuster, for which the author received a MacArthur ""genius grant"" of $1,000,000. The movie version was released in 1998 and has gross sales of more than $1.5 million. The film version of Gone with the wind is expected to be released in the fall of 2018. It will be released on Blu-ray and DVD. The first film version is scheduled for release on September 14, 2018. The second version will be available on September 25, 2018, and the third version on September 26, 2019.

(USA) and HarperCollins, Inc. (UK)"
42,Heart of Darkness,"'Heart of Darkness' opens in first person narrative; our narrator establishes the setting aboard a sailboat, ""The Nellie, a cruising yawl,"" anchored in the Thames River near Gravesend (England) Aboard are four others: the Director of Companies (the captain), the Lawyer (""the best of old fellows""), the Accountant (toying architecturally with dominoes), and Marlow (Charlie Marlow) - all share ""the bond of the sea"" - but Marlow is the only one that still ""followed the sea."" Marlow describes the trials and tribulations that must have been encountered by the first Romans who made their way to England; how mysterious and incomprehensible the place must have seemed to them. He describes his passage on ships to the wilderness - to the Company's station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation: ""amongst a waste of excavations"" - disorganized, machinery parts here and there, now and then explosions of demolition, weakened native black men, that have been demoralized, in chains, literally being worked to death, and strolling behind them a white Company man in a uniform carrying a rifle. Marlow leaves that station with a caravan to travel on foot some two hundred miles deeper into the wilderness. Upon arrival at the Central Station: ""the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show"" Marlow learns that at this station, Mr. Kurtz is far from being admired, but instead is resented by the manager (not only is Kurtz's position at Inner Station highly envied, but sentiment seems to be that he is not deserving of it) The journey up-river takes two months - two or four days to board the manager's steamboat. Once the steamboat is ready and underway, the story gets underway, and about the ""pilgrims"" and ""cannibals"" about the company. After fishing out of harm's way, Marlow meets the manager out on the river, and learns that Kurtz, more or less, is a first-class agent, and later adds: ""'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above—the Council in Europe, you know—mean him to be.'"" Marlow introduces the events that led to his appointment to captain a river-steamboat for an ivory trading company - the steamer he is to captain."
43,Hamlet,"Prince Hamlet of Denmark is the son of deceased King Hamlet and his wife, Queen Gertrude. The story opens on a chilly night at Elsinore, the Danish royal castle. Hamlet resolves to see the Ghost himself. The Ghost claims that it is the actual spirit of his father, and discloses that he—the elder Hamlet—was murdered by his brother Claudius pouring poison in his ear. He will have them stage a play, The Murder of Gonzago, re-enacting his father's murder and determine Claudius's guilt or innocence by studying his reaction to it. The court assembles to watch the play; Hamlet provides an agitated running commentary throughout. When the murder scene is presented, Claudius abruptly rises and leaves the room, which Hamlet sees as proof of his uncle's guilt. When he realises that he killed Ophelia's father, he is not remorseful, but calls Polonius ""Th wretched fool"" Hamlet hides his brother's body in England, ultimately revealing its location to the King, who sends Hamlet on a diplomatic pretext to get rid of the prince, accompanied by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Prior to Hamlet's death, the Ghost reveals that he is actually sending Hamlet to his death, and ultimately reveals the location of the body to the king, who takes it to Elsinius's castle. The play ends with Hamlet fleeing to England, accompanied (and closely watched) by the King and his bodyguards, and eventually revealing the body's location to Pol on his return to El sinore, leaving the King ultimately revealing the location to his son, Hamlet, and the Ghost. The ghost then dies, and Hamlet goes on to die in the play's final scene, in which he is finally reunited with his mother, the Queen, and his best friend, Horatio, in the middle of the courtyard of El Sinore. The final scene is set at the end of the play, when Hamlet is about to kill the Queen and cries out for help, but is stopped by the Queen's guards, who tell him to go to his room and wait for his mother. In the end, the play ends in a climactic battle between the Ghost and the King of England, who is killed by Hamlet in the climactic final scene of The Murder Of Gonzago. It is the last play written by the playwright, and is considered one of the greatest of all time."
44,Heretics of Dune,"Sandworms have reappeared on Arrakis (now called Rakis) and renewed the flow of the all-important spice melange to the galaxy. With Leto's death, a hugely complex economic system built on spice collapsed, resulting in trillions leaving known space in a great Scattering. A new civilization has risen, with three dominant powers: the Ixians, the Bene Tleilax, and the Bene Gesserit. However, people from the Scattering are returning with their own peculiar powers. The most powerful of these forces are the Honored Matres, a violent society of women bred and trained for combat and the sexual control of men. The Bene GESSerit is a matriarchal order of subtle political manipulators who possess superhuman abilities. It is led by the Reverend Mother Darwi Odrade, a loose cannon who does not obey normal Bene GEsserit prohibitions about love, and is also the biological daughter of Miles Teg, the main character in the book.

45,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Thomas ""Tom"" Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn have each come into a considerable sum of money as a result of their earlier adventures. Huck has been placed under the guardianship of the Widow Douglas, who, together with her sister, Miss Watson, is attempting to civilize him. His life is changed by the sudden reappearance of his shiftless father ""Pap"", an abusive parent and drunkard. During one of his father's absences Huck escapes, elaborately fakes his own murder, and sets off down the Mississippi River. While living quite comfortably in the wilderness along the Mississippi, Huck encounters Miss Watson's slave Jim on an island called Jackson's Island. Huck learns that Jim has also run away after he overheard Miss Watson’s plan to sell Jim downriver, where conditions for slaves were even harsher, because he would bring a price of $800. Huck and Jim's raft is swamped by a passing steamship, separating the two. Huck is given shelter by the Grangerfords, a prosperous local family. He becomes with Buck Granger, a boy about his age, and learns about a 30-year-old blood feud between another family and the Shepherdsons. The feud comes to a head when Buck's sister Sophia elopes with Harney Shepherdson, and all the males from this branch of the family are shot and killed. Upon seeing Buck's corpse, Huck is too devastated to write about everything that happened. However, he does describe how he narrowly avoids his own death in the gunfight together with Jim, later reuniting with the raft and later with the others on their way back to the U.S. The novel is set in fictional St. Petersburg, Missouri, sometime between 1835 (when the first steamboat sailed down theMississippi) and 1845.

It is implied that he will live the rest of his natural life in his condition.

48,Icehenge,"Icehenge is part mystery, part psychological drama, and is set in three distinct time periods. The story shifts from a failed Martian political revolution of 2248, to an expedition to explore a mysterious monument on the north pole of Pluto three centuries later. Ultimately, the story moves to a space station orbiting Saturn, home to a reclusive and wealthy woman who may hold the key to solving a mystery spanning centuries.

49,Leviticus,"Chapters 1–5 describe the various sacrifices from the sacrificers' point of view, although the priests are essential for handling the blood. Chapters 7–10 describe the consecration (by Moses) of Aaron and his sons as the first priests, the first sacrifices, and God's destruction of two of Aaron's sons for ritual offenses. With sacrifice and priesthood established, chapters 11–15 instruct the lay people on purity (or cleanliness) Eating certain animals produces uncleanliness, as does giving birth. Blasphemy is to be punished with death, and rules for the eating of sacrifices are set out. The Holiness code begins with a prohibition on all slaughter of animals outside the Temple, even for food, and then prohibits a long list of sexual contacts and also child sacrifice. The code ends by telling the Israelites they must choose between the law and prosperity on the one hand, or, on the other, horrible punishments, the worst of which will be expulsion from the land. Chapter 27 is a disparate and probably late addition telling about persons and things dedicated to the Lord and how vows can be redeemed instead of fulfilled. It begins with the ""holiness"" injunctions which give the code its name begin with the next section: penalties are imposed for the worship of Molech, consulting mediums and wizards, cursing one's parents and engaging in unlawful sex. The reasoning behind the food rules are obscure; for the rest the guiding principle seems to be that all these conditions involve a loss of ""life force"", usually but not always blood. A third goat is to sent into the desert to ""Azazel"", bearing the sins of the whole people. This is the only day on which the High Priest is to enter the holiest part of the sanctuary, the holy of holies. He is to sacrifice a bull for the Sins of the priests, and a goat for the sin of the laypeople. The name of Azazel may be a wilderness-demon, but its identity is mysterious. It is not known whether Azazel is a deity or just a name given to a demon by the Israelite people. The book ends with a warning that if you are found guilty of any crime, you will be punished by death, even though the penalty for such crimes is not severe. It was written in the 4th century BC, and is one of the oldest surviving books of the Bible. The Bible was written by Moses and Moses' son, Aaron, and was compiled by Moses after Moses' death."
50,Leaf by Niggle,"In this story, an artist, named Niggle, lives in a society that does not much value art. He paints a canvas of a great Tree with a forest in the distance. However, there are many mundane chores and duties that prevent Niggle from giving his work the attention it deserves, so it remains incomplete and is not fully realized. Eventually, Niggle is forced to take his trip, and cannot get out of it. He has not prepared, and as a result ends up in a kind of institution, in which he must perform menial labour each day. But he discovers that the new country he is sent to is in fact the country of the Tree and Forest of his great painting, now long abandoned and all but destroyed (except for the one perfect leaf of the title which is placed in the local museum) in the home to which he cannot return. The Tree here and now in this place is the true realization of his vision, not the flawed and incomplete form of his painting. Long after both Niggle and Parish have taken their journeys, the lovely field that they built together becomes a place for many travelers to visit before their final voyage into the Mountains, and it earns the name ""Niggle's Parish"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99, with a recommended age of 12+.

51,Macbeth,"Macbeth is the Thane of Glamis and Banquohave. He is the kinsman of King Duncan of Scotland. The Three Witches tell him he will father a line of kings, though he will not be one. Lady Macbeth wishes him to murder Duncan in order to obtain kingship. She frames Duncan’s sleeping servants for the murder by placing bloody daggers on them. The rightful heirs' flight makes them suspects and MacBeth assumes the throne as the new King of Scotland as a kinsman. The ghost of Banquo's son Fleance returns and causes a riot at a banquet, until a desperate Lady Mac beth tells them that her husband is merely afflicted with a malady with a familiar and harmless malady. A third murderer appears in the park before the murder, but Fleance succeeds in killing the assassins. The third murderer then returns to the banquet and raves at the sight of an empty chair, causing the same panic at the others at the banquet.

53,"Moby-Dick; or, The Whale","""Moby-Dick"" begins with the line ""Call me Ishmael"" The novel describes numerous ""gams,"" social meetings of two ships on the open sea. The ship's captain, Ahab, is nowhere to be seen; nevertheless, they are told of him as a ""grand, ungodly, godlike man"" Ahab has secretly brought along his own boat crew, including a mysterious harpooneer named Fedallah (also referred to as 'the Parsee'), an inscrutable figure with a sinister influence over Ahab.

55,Neuromancer,"Henry Dorsett Case is a low-level hustler in the dystopian underworld of Chiba City, Japan. Case's central nervous system was damaged with a mycotoxin, leaving him unable to use keyboard skills to access the global computer network in cyberspace. Case is saved by Molly Millions, an augmented ""street samurai"" and mercenary for a shadowy ex-military officer named Armitage, who offers to cure Case in exchange for his services as a hacker. Case jumps at the chance to regain his life as a ""console cowboy,"" but neither Case nor Molly know what Armitages is really planning. The trail leads Case and Molly to a powerful artificial intelligence named Wintermute, created by the plutocratic Tessier-Ashpool family, who spend most of their inactive time in cryonic preservation inside Villa Straylight, a labyrinthine space habitat located at one end of Freeside, and functioning primarily as a Las Vegas-style space resort for the wealthy. The team recruits Peter Riviera, an artist, thief, and drug addict who is able to project detailed holographic illusions with the aid of sophisticated cybernetic implants.

56,Cryptonomicon,"The action takes place in two periods: the Second World War and the late 1990s, during the Internet boom. In 1942, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, a young U.S. Navy code breaker and mathematical genius, is assigned to the newly formed joint British and American Detachment 2702. Circa 1997, Randy Waterhouse (Lawrence's grandson) joins his old Dungeons and Dragons companion Avi Halaby in a new startup, providing Pinoy-grams to migrant Filipinos via new fiber-optic cables.

57,No Logo,"Klein argues that there has been a shift in the usage of branding. She argues that large multinational corporations consider the marketing of a brand name to be more important than the actual manufacture of products. The book discusses how brands use their size and clout to limit the number of choices available to the public – whether through market dominance (Wal-Mart) or through aggressive invasion of a region (Starbucks) Klein argues that the goal of each company is to become the dominant force in its respective field. The final section of the book discusses various movements that have sprung up during the 1990s. These include the Adbusters magazine and Reclaim the Streets movements. Klein concludes by contrasting consumerism and consumerism, opting for the latter, and opting for a potentially broad-based resistance movement as well as a potentially marginalised one. She writes: ""When I started this book, I honestly didn't know whether I was covering marginalized atomized resistance or the birth of a broad consumer-based movement"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99 and includes four sections: ""No Space,"" ""No Choice"", ""No Jobs"", and ""No Logo"" The first three deal with the negative effects of brand-oriented corporate activity, while the fourth discusses various methods people have taken in order to fight back, such as the McLibel trial, to put an end to sweatshop labour in the U.S. and the sweatshop movement in the UK. The last section looks at ways in which brands have ""muscled"" their presence into the school system, and how in doing so, they have used their position to gather information about the students. It also looks at the way in which manufacturing jobs move from local factories to foreign countries, and particularly to places known as export processing zones, leading to dire working conditions. The term McJob is introduced, defined as a job with poor compensation that does not keep pace with inflation, inflexible or undesirable hours, little chance of advancement, and high levels of stress. Meanwhile, the public is being sold the perception that these jobs are temporary employment for students and recent graduates, and therefore need not offer living wages or benefits. All of this is set against a backdrop of massive profits and wealth being produced within the corporate sector. The result is a new generation of employees who resent the success of the companies they work for, along with rising unemployment, disregard for the environment, and the ever-increasing presence of advertising. This resentment along with labour abuses abroad breeds a new disdain for corporations."
58,Odyssey,"The Odyssey begins ten years after the end of the ten-year Trojan War that is the subject of the Iliad. Odysseus has still not returned home from the war. His son Telemachus is sharing his absent father’s house on the island of Ithaca with his mother Penelope and a crowd of 108 boisterous young men, ""the Suitors"" The story of OdysSEus is told after he has spent seven years in captivity on Calypso's island, Ogygia. After a piratical raid on the land of Ismaros, he and his twelve ships were driven off the course by storms. They were then captured by the Cyclops, who blinded him with a wooden stake. Unable to hide his emotion as he relives this episode, he then reveals his identity at last to tell the story of his return from Troy. He asks Demodocus to return to the Trojan War theme and tell of the Trojan Horse, a stratagem in which he had played a leading role. He then begins to tell his story of escaping from Troy with the help of his great-grandfather, the messenger god Hermes, who has been sent by Zeus in response to Athena's plea. He is finally able to leave Troy and return home to his wife Penelope. In the end, the story ends with Odyseus returning to Troy and returning to his home in the Trojan Peninsula. The Iliads are the most famous work of ancient Greek literature and are considered one of the most important. They include the works of Homer, Hesiod, Sophocles, and others, as well as works by Alexander Pushkin and T.S. Odyssey. The Odyssey is published by Oxford University Press and is available in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. It is published in hardback and hardback, with a limited edition of 1,500 copies. The first edition of the Odyssey was published in 1776.

59,Othello,"The play opens with Roderigo, a rich and dissolute gentleman, complaining to Iago, a high-ranking soldier, that Iago has not told him about the secret marriage between Desdemona, the daughter of a Senator named Brabantio, and Othello. Iago is upset by this development because he had previously asked her father for her hand in marriage. He is also angry because he believes, or at least gives the pretence of belief, that O thello slept with his wife Emilia. He also denounces Cassio as a scholarly tactician with no real battle experience; in contrast, Iago was a battle-tested soldier. The play ends with Iago plotting to kill Cassio, because Cassio has just been appointed governor of Cyprus, and because Iago argues that if Cassio lives, Othello will abandon his pursuit of Des Demona and abandon his efforts to take the office of Venetian governor. It is the first of a series of plays by the Italian playwright Giacomo Puccini, who also wrote the libretto for ""The Marriage of Cassio and the City of Cypriot"" The play is set in Venice in the 16th century. It was first performed at the Grand Theatre of Venice in Venice, and was later transferred to the Grand Imperial Theatre in Venice. It has been staged at the Metropolitan Theatre in New York City and the Metropolitan Opera in the United States, as well as in London, Paris, Berlin, and Paris. The cast of the play has a cast of around 50. The composer has said that he hopes the play will be remembered as ""one of the greatest plays of all time"" and that it has had a ""profoundly positive impact on the lives of people around the world"" It has also been described as one of the ""greatest plays of the 20th century"" and has been called ""the greatest play of our time"" by the New York Times and The New York Review of Books, among other critics. The opera is based on the playwright's novel of the same name, ""Othello and the Battle of the Bulge"" by Toni Morrison. The librettist has said the play is a ""masterwork of art"" and ""a masterpiece of Shakespeare's playwriting"". The play has been praised by critics as ""the best play ever written"" and a ""textbook of the history of the Italian drama"""
60,On War,"Clausewitz's On War is considered one of the most influential books of the 20th century. Clausewitz argued that war should never be seen as having any purpose in itself, but should be an instrument of politics. On War has been seen by some prominent critics as an argument for ""total war"" It has been blamed for the level of destruction involved in the First and Second World Wars, but it seems rather that Clausewitz (who did not actually use the term "" total war"") had merely foreseen the inevitable development that started with the huge, patriotically motivated armies of the Napoleonic wars. He says Clausewitz's work is rooted in the world of the nation state, and that he rarely takes the state ""almost for granted,"" as he did in previous Westphalia-era wars. The book contains a wealth of historical examples used to illustrate its various concepts, including Frederick II of Prussia (the Great) and Napoleon. It has also been seen as ""the preeminent military strategist and political strategist of modern times"" by Robert Osgood and Martin van Creveld, in 1979 and 1979, respectively. It was published in Germany in 1859, and has since been translated into English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and other languages. It is available in English, German, French and Italian, as well as in German and English-speaking parts of Europe and North America, with an English-language version available in the U.S. and Canada, and a German-speaking version in the United States and Canada. The German version of On War can be purchased on Amazon for about $50.

61,The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch,"The story begins in a future world where global warming has resulted in global temperatures so high that in most of the world it is unsafe to be outside without special cooling gear during daylight hours. In a desperate bid to preserve humanity and ease population burdens on Earth, the UN has initiated a ""draft"" for colonizing the nearby planets. The unwilling colonists have fallen prey to a form of escapism involving the use of an illegal drug (CAN-D) in concert with ""layouts"". Layouts are physical props intended to simulate a sort of alternate reality where life is easier than either the grim existence of the colonist in their marginal off-world colonies, or even Earth. The illegal drug CAN-D allows people to ""share"" their experience of the ""Perky Pat"" (the name of the main female character in the simulated world) The novel opens shortly after Barney Mayerson, P.P. Layouts' top precognitive (someone who can glimpse future possibilities and sort out the most likely to actually occur), has received a "" draft notice"" from the UN for involuntary resettlement as a colonist on Mars. In the future, Mayerson arrives in New York two years after the death of Palmer Eldritch, who appears in holographic form to hallucinate a world where he does not control his ""hallucination"" Like Bulero, he finds himself in the future where he speaks with his future self, and also encounters several manifestations of Eldritch. The novel ends shortly after Mayerson returns to Earth and fires his assistant, Roni Fugate, because he was afraid he was going to be responsible for Eldritch's death. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audiobook.

64,Radio Free Albemuth,"In this alternate history the corrupt US President Ferris F. Fremont (FFF for 666, ‘F’ being the 6th letter in the alphabet, see Number of the Beast) becomes Chief Executive in the late Nineteen-Sixties. Ironically enough, the President's paranoia and opportunism lead to the establishment of a real resistance movement. As with VALIS, Radio Free Albemuth deals with author Philip Dick's highly personal style of Christianity (or Gnosticism) It further examines the moral and ethical repercussions of informing on trusting friends for the authorities. Also prominent is Dick's dislike of the Republican Party, satirizing Nixon's America as a Stalinist or neo-fascist police state. Dick himself is a major character, though fictitious protagonist Nicholas Brady serves as a vehicle for Dick's alleged gnostic theophany on February 11, 1974. In addition, Sadassa Silvia is a character who claims that Ferris Fremont is actually a communist covert agent recruited bySadassa's mother when Fremont was still a teenager. Dick narrates the concluding passage about his life in a concentration camp, where his supposedly latest work is actually penned by a ghost writer and regime-approved hack. He and his friends, it turns out, were just a decoy set up by VALIS to detour the government from stopping a much more popular A-List band from releasing a similar record with a better-established recording company. As Dick realizes this and hears youngsters repeating the lyrics he realizes that salvation may lie within the hearts and minds of the next generation. The novel is autobiographical, as with its successor,VALIS, this novel is partly based on Dick's own experiences with his faith and his time as a young man in the U.S. in the 1960s. It is published by Simon & Schuster, with a cover price of $24.99 (£16.99) and a print run of 1,000 copies of 2,500 copies of the book is expected to sell for $2,500 (£1,500) in the UK. The book is available in hardback and hardback, as well as on Kindle, with prices starting at £12.99 ($16) and £14.99 (both prices include a free download of the audiobook version of the novel, which includes the audio commentary by Philip Dick and the book's author's interview with Nicholas Brady.

66,Pale Fire,"After Shade was murdered, Kinbote acquired the manuscript, including some variants, and has taken it upon himself to oversee the poem's publication. After Shade was killed, KinBote narrates how Gradus killed Shade by mistake. KinbOTE's second story deals with King Charles II, ""The Beloved,"" the deposed king of Zembla. In the last note, to the missing line 1000, Kin bote narrate how Gradu killed Shade. Kin botes his own story, notably including what he thinks of as his friendship with Shade. One of Kinbotes annotations to Shade's poem (corresponding to line 493) addresses the subject of suicide at some length. Brian Boyd has argued that internal evidence points to Kinboting's suicide. Nabokov said in an interview that Kinboted committed suicide after finishing the book. The critic Michael Wood has stated, ""This is authorial trespassing, and we don't have to pay attention to it,"" but Brian Boyd argues that it is a sign of Kin boting his own work, and that Kin bares all responsibility for the work he has written in the book, including the writing of the poem.

67,Pacific Overtures,"Pacific Overtures is a Japanese playwright's version of an American musical about American influences on Japan. The play is set in July 1853, and follows the story of Kayama, a minor samurai, and Manjiro, the only man in Japan who has dealt with Americans. Kayama is sent to meet with the Americans but he is rejected as not important enough. He enlists the aid of ManJiro, and disguised as a great lord, he gets an answer from them. Commodore Perry announces that he must meet the Shogun within six days or else he will shell the city. With the Shogun dead, Kayama devises a plan by which the Americans, thanks to a covering of tatami mats and a raised Treaty House, can be received without having, technically, to set foot on Japanese soil. The two men pass a Madam instructing her inexperienced Girls in the art of seduction as they prepare to ""Welcome to Kanagawa"" the foreign devils. The negotiations themselves are seen through the memory of three who were there: a warrior who could hear the debates but not see it from his hiding place in the floor of the house, a young boy recalling that without ""Someone In a Tree"", a silent watcher, history may have been incomplete. The child emperor (portrayed by a puppet manipulated by his advisors) reacts with pleasure to the departure of the Americans. He promotes Lord Abe to Shogun and Kayama to Governor of Uraga and Man Jiro to the rank of Samurai. The crisis appears to have passed, but to the surprise of Lord Abe the Americans return to request formal trading arrangements. To the tune of a Sousa march, they bid Japan ""Please Hello"" and are followed by a Gilbert and Sullivan-style British Admiral, a clog-dancing Dutch Admiral and a gloomy Russian. They send a politically charged gift to the Emperor, who tells a vivid, allegorical tale of a brave young emperor who frees himself from his cowardly Shogun. But there are other changes prompted by the westernization by British Sailors, a Bowler and ""A Bowler Hatler"" Three years later, the Emperor frees the young emperor and adopts the manners and dress of the newcomers, proudly displaying his new watch, cutaway coat and bowler hat. He returns home to find her dead from seppuku. But it is too late to save Tamate, his wife, since it will result in certain failure and shame. She expresses her feelings in dance as two Observers describe the scene."
68,Romeo and Juliet,"The play, set in Verona, begins with a street brawl between Montague and Capulet supporters who are sworn enemies. Later, Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter, but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years. Lady Capulet and Juliet's nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris's courtship. Meanwhile, Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo, Montague's son, about Romeo's recent depression. BenVolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline, one of Capulet's nieces. Persuaded, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. They are secretly married the next day. Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet's chamber, where they consummate their marriage. Capulet, misinterpreting Juliet's grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris's ""joyful bride"" On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince's elegy for the lovers: ""For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."" The Prince, now having lost a kinsman in the warring families' feud, exiles Romeo from Verona,. with threat of execution upon return. Grief-stricken and wracked with guilt, Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt. He then buys poison from an apothecary and goes to the Capulets' crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The Prince and the families of the feuding Families and the King of Verona meet to discuss how to reconcile the families and end the violent feud, and to find the families reconciled. The King and the Queen meet to talk about how to end the feud and how to reunite the families."
69,Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead,"The play opens with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern betting on coin flips. The reader learns why they are where they are: the King has sent for them. A troupe of Tragedians arrives and offers the two men a show. The next two scenes are from the plot of Hamlet. The play moves beyond the scope of what the reader sees in Hamlet; characters resembling the pair are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of English courtiers, foreshadowing their true fate. The Player returns to the stage. He is angry that the pair had not earlier stayed to watch their play. He tells them to stop questioning their existence because, upon examination, life appears too chaotic to comprehend. The Act closes with another scene from Hamlet in which they finally meet the Prince face to face. The Players is led to believe that the audience has no knowledge of how the pair got there. The stage becomes black and presumably the characters go to sleep, presumably to go to Hamlet to be killed, and presumably to sleep themselves.

70,Ringworld,"The novel opens in 2850. Louis Gridley Wu is celebrating his 200th birthday. He is offered one of three open positions on an exploration voyage beyond Known Space. Two other explorers, Speaker-to-Animals and Teela Brown, also join the voyage. The expedition's goal is to explore a ringworld: an artificial ring about one million miles wide and approximately the diameter of Earth's orbit. None of the crew's attempts at contacting the Ringworld succeed, and their ship is disabled by its automated meteor defense system. The ship's defences keep the crew compartment and many of the ship's systems intact, including the faster-than-light drive (hyperdrive) But the normal drive is destroyed, leaving them unable to launch back into space to use the hyperdrive. The team now has to find a way to get back to space, as well as fulfilling their original mission – learning more about the Ring world. They encounter apparently human Ringworld natives. The natives think that the crew are the Engineers of the Ring, whom they revere as gods. The crew is attacked when they commit a ""blasphemy"". They continue their journey during which Nessus is forced to reveal some Puppeteer secrets: they have performed indirect ""breeding experiments"" on both humans (breeding for luck) and kzin (breedingfor less aggressiveness) The resulting hostility forces Nessus to abandon the other three and follow them at a safe distance. The four explorers, with Seeker and Prill, use the floating police station as a vehicle to travel to the explorers' crashed ship. Along the way, Teela and Seeker choose to remain behind and remain on Ringworld. The remaining explorers and the remaining explorers collect one end of the shadow square wire that was dislodged when the ship crashed, dragging the wire behind them as they travel. Reaching the wreck, Louis uses the shadow wire to tether the ship to the police station and then continues to pull the wire up to the summit of the enormous mountain near their crash site. The mountain does not appear on the original map of the original Ringworld, leading Louis to conclude that it is in fact in the fact of a meteor impact with the underside of the ring floor, which pushed it up from the ground. The explorers then use the wire to pull up the mountain, leading them to the ""Fist-of-God"" site near the crash site, which is the enormous ""mountain"" of theRingworld."

72,Rendezvous with Rama,"""Rama"" is an alien star ship, initially mistaken for an asteroid categorised as ""31/439"" It is detected by astronomers in the year 2130 while still outside the orbit of Jupiter. A manned solar survey vessel Endeavour is sent to study Rama, as it is the only ship close enough to do so in the brief period Rama will spend in our solar system. The 20+ crew, led by Commander Bill Norton, enters Rama through triple airlocks, and explores the vast 16-km wide by 50-km long cylindrical world of its interior. The nature and purpose of the starship and its creators remains enigmatic throughout the book. The astronauts discover several features, including ""cities"" (odd blocky shapes that look like buildings) that actually served as factories, a sea that stretches in a band around Rama dubbed the Cylindrical Sea, and seven massive cones at the southern end of Rama - believed to form part of the propulsion system. When the crew arrive at their base, they see a variety of odd creatures inspecting their camp. When one is found damaged and apparently lifeless, the team's doctor inspects it and names it ""biot"" or a hybrid of a biological entity and robot. The Hermian colonists have concluded that Rama is a potential threat to them and send a rocket-mounted bomb to destroy it. It is successfully defused by the United Planets Committee and both the Planets, based on both the Earth and the moon, have been monitoring events inside Rama and giving feedback to the team on the events inside the starship. The members of the Rama Committee are believed to be servants of the ship's builders and still maintainers of the spaceship. The crew of the U.S. government set up the Spaceguard system as an early warning of arrivals from deep space in 2077. The government of Earth sets up the spaceguard system in response to a major disaster caused by a meteorite falling in Eastern Italy in 2076. The book is set in the years 2130 and 2077, and follows the events of the first encounter with an alien space ship, Rama. It was published by Simon & Schuster in 1998 and is available in hardback, paperback, and e-book. It has been described as a sci-fi/fantasy novel with an emphasis on the themes of space travel and alien life. The novel is expected to be released in October 2014."
73,Sense and Sensibility,"When Mr. Dashwood dies, his estate, Norland Park, passes directly to his only son John, the child of his first wife. John and Fanny immediately take up their place as the new owners of Norland, while the Dashwood women are reduced to the position of unwelcome guests. In the meantime, Fanny's brother, Edward Ferrars, visits Norland and soon forms an attachment with Elinor. Marianne, out for a walk, gets caught in the rain, slips and sprains her ankle. The dashing, handsome John Willoughby sees the accident and assists her. Soon Marianne receives a curt letter enclosing their former correspondence and love tokens, including a lock of her hair and informing her of his engagement to a young lady of large fortune. The Dashwoods move their family to Barton Cottage in Devonshire, near the home of her cousin, Sir John Middleton. Their new home lacks many of the conveniences that they have been used to, however they are warmly received by Sir John, and welcomed into the local society, meeting his wife, Lady Middleton, his mother-in-law, Mrs Jennings and his friend, the grave, quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. It soon becomes apparent that Colonel Brandon is attracted to Marianne and Mrs Jennings teases them about it. Unexpectedly one day, Mr. Willougby informs the Dashwoods that his aunt is sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Mariann is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow. As a result the Miss Steele sisters, Anne and Lucy, come to stay at Barton Park. Lucy informs Elin or of her secret four year engagement to Edward Ferrar.

Edward is entreated to break the engagement on pain of disinitance, but refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining widespread sympathy for his gentlemanly conduct, and sympathy from El inor and Marianne who understand how much he has sacrificed over the years. In meantime, the sisters have come to London as guests of the DashWoods, the Londoners, the Dash Woods' half-sisters."
74,Speaker for the Dead,"On Novinha's request for a Speaker, Andrew Wiggin leaves for Lusitania, a colony turned into a virtual prison. The colony is devoted to the work of xenologers who study the Pequeninos, the first sentient beings found since the destruction of Formics. Ender decides to leave his sister Valentine behind (she is married and pregnant) after traveling with her for many years. Ender also takes responsibility for attempting to heal the Ribeira family, and manages to adopt (or perhaps is adopted by) most of the children within their first meeting. He also takes a strong interest in the pequenino, and eventually (in direct violation of Starways Congress law) meets with them in person. The Hive Queen has also managed to make contact with the peqeninos and has told them a number of things&mdash;including that the original Speaker for the Dead is not only the original Xenocide as well, but also romantically involved with Miro. Both Zenadors (a shortened form of the word Xenocide) do not believe that the Hive Queen very emphatically wants to be revived and freed, and do not want to be called ""Zenadors"" The colony's charter is revoked and all humans are ordered to take twenty-two years to travel to the nearest world for a trial that would take place on that world (a journey that would also take 20 years to take place in the real world). The trial takes place on the world called Starways, which is on the planet of Ouanda, which has been deliberately introducing new technology into the piggy lifestyle. The trial is held on Starways and Miro and Ouanda are the only ones who are allowed to take part in it, and they do so in secret, in violation of the Starways congress' rules. This is the first time that the colony has been open to non-humans, and it is the only time that humans have been allowed to leave the colony for any length of time at all. It is also the last time the colony will be open to humans for any period of time, as the colony is closed off to all non-piggies except those who have been trained to be xenologists by the hive queen. The book ends on a cliffhanging cliffhanger, with the last words of the original ""Xenocide"" being read by Miro, who is now a member of the colony, and the first words of ""Starways"" read by Ender."
75,Starship Troopers," Starship Troopers is one of only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion. It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico, a cap(sule) trooper in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry. The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette Rodger Young, serving with the platoon known as ""Rasczak's Roughnecks"" Interspersed throughout the book are flashbacks to Rico's high school History and Moral Philosophy course, which describe how the rights of a full Citizen (to vote, and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service. Some see Dubois as speaking for Heinlein throughout the novel; he delivers what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence, it ""... has settled more issues in history than has any other factor."" Fleet Sergeant Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades seem primarily to be a contrast with Dubois. At some point during Rico's training, the ""Bug War"" has changed from border incidents to formal war, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations. The war ""officially"" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires (which kills Rico's mother who was visiting). Rico briefly describes the Terran. Federation's loss at the Battle of Klendathu, during which his ship is decimated and his unit is destroyed. This part of the book focuses on the relationship between non-missioned officers and non-comed officers, as well as the relationship in the book between Rico and his commanding officer, Sgt. Charles Zim. The book is chronologically placed between chapters 10 and 11, which would be placed between the beginning of the novel (which would be chronologically between chapters 11 and 11) and the end of chapter 11. It has been described as one of the best sci-fi novels of the 20th century, along with ""The Matrix"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" The novel was written in the wake of the collapse of the ""20th century Western democracies"", brought on by both social failures at home (among which appear to be poor handling of juvenile delinquency) and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas. The story then flashes back to Puerto Rico's graduation from high school and his decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father, who disowns him. We learn, later, that his rants are part of a policy intended to scare off applicants signing up without conviction. Five chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience at Camp Arthur Currie."
76,Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, begs for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However the Green Knight neither falls nor falters but reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel before he rides away. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle who is the sorceress Morgan Fay, who intended to test Arthur's sisters and terrify Guinesevere.

78,The Lord of the Rings,"Long before the events of the novel, the Dark Lord Sauron forges the One Ring to dominate the other Rings of Power and corrupt those who wear them. Over two thousand years later, the Ring is found by a river-dwelling hobbit called Déagol. The Ring extends his lifespan and transforms him over the course of hundreds of years into a twisted, corrupted creature called Gollum. He loses the Ring, his ""precious"", and, as recounted in The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins finds it. Meanwhile, Sauron reassumes physical form and takes back his old realm of Mordor. The Council of Elrond reveals much significant history about Sauron and the Ring. They decide to destroy the Ring by returning it to the flames of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo volunteers to take on this daunting task, and a ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is formed to aid him: Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and the Man Boromir, son of the Ruling Steward Denethor of the realm of Gondor. They travel down the River Anduin to the hill of Amon Hen, where they are attacked by the Watcher in the Water before the gate. After repulsing an attack, they are pursued by orcs and Balrogves, but in their struggle, both fall into a deep chasm. The others escape and take refuge in the Elven forest of Lórien, where the others are counselled by Galadriel and Celeadriel. Meanwhile,. Frodo escapes and determines to continue the quest alone, though Sam guesses his intent and kills him. After agonizing over which gifts to take, Frodo succumbs to the lure and attempts to take the Ring from him, which agonizingly agonizes him over. He eventually takes the Ring and flees to Rivendell, where he is taken in by Gandalf the Grey and his company of Dwarves, and realizes the fate of Balin and his powerful company of dwarves. After a failed attempt to cross the Misty Mountains via the pass below Caradhras, the company are forced to try a more perilous path through the Mines of Moria. Once inside, they discover the fate, and realize the powerful struggle, and they are chased by an ancient, powerful, and powerful force called the Nazgûl."
79,The Doors of Perception,"Huxley was given 4/10 of a gram of mescaline at 11:00 am one day in May 1953. He writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind. The experience, he asserts, is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but simply 'is' He likens it to Meister Eckhart’s ‘istigheit’ or ‘is-ness’, and Plato's ‘Being’ but not separated from ‘Becoming’ He feels he understands the Hindu concept of Satchitananda, as well as the Zen koan that ‘the dharma body of the Buddha is in the hedge’ and Buddhist suchness. Huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential. He concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height, but not its fullness. The book is characterized by the urge to transcend one's self through times and cultures. He reasons that better, healthier, ‘doors’ are needed in cultures than alcohol and tobacco. Mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers, but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some negative reactions can be found in religion, but it is unlikely that this will ever happen. The final insight is taken from Buddhist scripture: that within sameness there is difference, although that difference is not different from sameness. He finishes with his final reflections on the meaning of his experience. He feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescalin. He attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people. Cézanne's Self portrait with a straw hat seems to him as incredibly pretentious, while Vermeer's human still lives (also, the Le Nain Brothers and Vuillard) are the nearest to reflecting this not-self state. He reflects that spiritual literature, including the works of Jacob Boehme, William Law and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, talk of these pains and terrors. After lunch and the drive to the WBDS he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind and returns home to his normal life. In summary, the ability to think straight is not reduced while under the influence of meshaline, visual impressions are intensified, and the human experimenter will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating. He mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the World's Biggest Drug Store (WBDS) where he was presented with books on art. In one book, the dress in Botticelli's Judith provokes a reflection on drapery."
80,The Time Machine,"The book's protagonist is an English scientist and gentleman inventor living in Richmond, Surrey, identified by a narrator simply as the Time Traveller. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth dimension, and his demonstration of a tabletop model machine for travelling through it. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator. In the new narrative, he tests his device with a journey that takes him to 802,701 A.D., where he meets the Eloi, a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, doing no work and having a frugivorous diet. Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the Morlocks, ape-like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. He travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth, menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out. Overwhelmed, he returns to his laboratory, arriving just three hours after he originally left. The original narrator takes over and that he returned the next day, finding him in final preparations for a journey. Three years later, the narrator promises to return, but three years later the narrator despairs of ever learning what became of him. The time machine is found missing, and he eventually works out that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. The Morlocks use the time machine as bait to ensnare the traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks. He saves Weena from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days."
81,The Shockwave Rider,"The novel is set in the weeks following Nick's recapture after several years on the run. It alternating between moral arguments with his interrogator, who is trying to discover why the program's star pupil had absconded.

Nick returns to Kate and confesses that he is not what he seems, asking for her help. She conducts him to one of the ""paid avoidance areas"" in California, where people are paid to do without the full panoply of modern technology. After Nick risks exposure yet again in one of these places, they move to the least known one, a town called Precipice. The inhabitants include intelligent dogs that escaped from the projects that Kate's father worked on. The town is also the home of ""Hearing Aid"", an anonymous telephone confession service accessible to anyone in the country. People call the service and simply talk. Some rant, others seek sympathy, still others commit suicide while on the phone. The only response Hearing Aid gives to a caller is ""Only I heard that, I hope it helped."" Nick and Kate settle into the community. He hits her, and then fills her with remorse, when she reveals his location to the authorities. At the end of the novel, Nick responds to the leader of Tarnover by attempting to warn him of the gangs and cripples him in front of a nationwide audience. He responds by saying ""Roman circus"" to an audience of ""all comers"" which live and fight to an ""all-comers"" challenge to the country, which he responds to by calling them ""Roman clowns"" The novel is also known as the ""Ten Nines"" after the phone number used to call it: 999-999-9999.

83,Mort,"As a teenager, Mort had a personality and temperament that made him rather unsuited to the family farming business. Mort's father, named Lezek, felt that Mort thought too much, which prevented him from achieving anything practical. Lezek took him to a local hiring fair, hoping that Mort would land an apprenticeship with some tradesman. At the job fair, Mort at first has no luck attracting the interest of an employer. Then, just before the stroke of midnight, a man concealed in a black cloak arrives on a white horse. He says he is looking for a young man to assist him in his work and selects Mort for the job. The man turns out to be Death, and Mort is given an apprenticeships in ushering souls into the next world (though his father thinks he's been apprenticed to an undertaker). When it is a princess' time to die, Mort, instead of ushering her soul, saves her from death, dramatically altering a part of the Discworld's reality. However, the princess, for whom Mort has a developing infatuation, does not have long to live, and he must try to save her, once again, from a seemingly unstoppable death.

This pearl is given to Mort for safe-keeping. AtThe end of the novel, Mort marries Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter. As Mort begins to do most of Death's ""Duty"", he loses some of his former character traits, and essentially starts to become more like Death himself. Death, in turn, yearns to relish what being human is truly like and travels to Ankh-Morpork to indulge in new experiences and attempt to feel real human emotion. This is where Death meets Mort and marries him, and the two are together for a time. The pearl is then given to the princess for safe keeping, and is kept by the princess as a keepsake for Mort to keep her safe from another death in the future. Mort is sent back to his home world, and Death is sent to his own world."

87,The Screwtape Letters,"The Screwtape Letters is a 1941 novel by C.S. Lewis. It is a series of letters from the demon Screwtapes to Wormwood, the tempter in Hell. Lewis also wrote the sequel Screwtaped Proposes a Toast in 1959. Both books have been released on audio cassette and CD with narration by John Cleese and Joss Ackland.

88,The Pit and the Pendulum,"The story takes place during the Spanish Inquisition. At the beginning of the story an unnamed narrator is brought to trial before various sinister judges. He is condemned to death and finds himself in a pitch black compartment. Before him are seven tall white candles on a table, and, as they melt, his hopes of survival diminish. He then sees a painted picture of Father Time on the ceiling; hanging from the figure is a gigantic scythe-like pendulum swinging slowly back and forth. The pendulum is inexorably sliding downwards and will eventually kill him. However the condemned man is able to attract rats to his bonds with meat left for him to eat and they start chewing through the ropes. As he gazes into the pit, he decides that no fate could be worse than falling into it. The French Army has taken Toledo and the Inquisition is in the hands of its enemies. It is implied by the text that the narrator fears what he sees at the bottom of the pit. The exact cause of his fear is not clearly stated. However, as the narrator moves back from the Pit, he sees that the red-hot walls are leaving him with no foothold. The walls rush back and an arm catches him. As the prisoner begins to fall into thepit, he hears human voices. The narrator then falls into the Pit and is saved by the arm of a man who has been waiting for him in the pit for some time. The story ends with the narrator being rescued by the man who had been waiting to rescue him from the pit and the two of them walking to the other side of the cell. The prisoner is then taken to a different cell and is reunited with his captor, who is also taken to the same cell where he had been held by the French Army. The two men are reunited and the narrator is taken back to his cell to continue his journey to the end of the book. The final chapter is set during the reign of King Charles I of Spain and is set in the year 1536. The last words of the narrator are: “I am going to die.” The narrator is then led to a cell that is slightly illuminated and that he is bound to a wooden board by ropes. After losing consciousness again the narrator discovers that the prison is slightly illumination and he is tied to a board by rope. He looks up in horror to see a painting of Father time on the ceilings and sees that it is swinging slowly towards him. The painting is drawn back to the ceiling and the prisoner breaks free of the ropes and watches as the pendulum reaches a point inches above his heart."

90,The Cardinal of the Kremlin,"CIA analyst Jack Ryan attends a diplomatic conference in Moscow as part of an American delegation to the Soviet Union. He learns that the CIA’s most highly-placed agent, codenamed ""CARDINAL"", is none other than Colonel Mikhail Semyonovich Filitov. Ryan concocts a plan to both secure the return of Filtov and arrange the defection of the sitting KGB chairman, Nikolay Borissovich Gerasimov. Ryan schemes to go public with the prior capture of Soviet submarine Red October, banking on the political instability of the Soviet Politburo. In the end, the guerrillas destroy a large amount of Soviet equipment, including the death of The Archer. Ryan returns to the United States, where he and several others attend the funeral of Filitovo, who had died of heart disease in the months following his CIA debriefing period. Ryan, always working to keep the peace, explains to him, ""One way or another, we all fight for what we believe in that gives us some common ground?"" Doesn't we believe that in that common ground that we are all fighting for what gives us common ground? That's the question we're all trying to figure out, isn't it? The answer is yes, of course, because we all believe in common ground, and that's what we're trying to fight for. We're all just trying to find our way to the same place in the world that we all live in, and find our common ground in the same way. We all want to live in a world where we're not fighting each other for our lives, and we can live in peace with each other, even if we don't know it. We can all just live our lives as we choose to do so. We just have to find a way to do it."" -- Jack Ryan, in ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" (1998) ""The man who KNEW too much"" is the central character of this novel, as well as the book's other plot twists and turns. The book is written by Mark O'Mara and is published by Simon & Schuster at a cost of $24.99 (including taxes) and $16.95 (with a p&p discount). The film is scheduled to be released on November 14, 1998. ""The Jack Ryan Story"" is released by Simon&Schuster at 9 p.m. ET (GMT-8) and is available on DVD and Blu-ray."
91,Debt of Honor,"Jack Ryan is recruited as National Security Advisor by President Roger Durling. CIA officers John Clark and Domingo Chavez are sent to Japan to reactivate a former KGB spy network in order to gain intelligence. Ryan eliminates Japan's AWACS system through a series of ""accidents"" using widely dispersed U.S. assets, allowing B-2 bombers to destroy the silos. Ryan engineers a ""do-over"", where all of the transactions on the day of the mass deletion are ignored and all assets are restored to their state at the start of business that day. America's economy is restored with only minor disruption. Japan immediately sues for peace, offering international talks and seemingly free elections in the Marianas. Cornered, current prime minister resigns, ceding power to his predecessor. Japanese government accepts America's generous offer of status quo ante ante. President Durling faces another less important political crisis: Vice-President Ed Kealty is forced to resign after being accused of drugging and raping a former member of his staff. Nearly the entire presidential line of succession is eliminated before Ryan is confirmed as vice-president. Ryan escapes the crisis and narrowly escapes the attack and kills an embittered Japan Air Lines pilot driven by the deaths of his son and brother during the previous conflict. He then flies directly into the Capitol and assassinates his brother and son-in-law. Ryan's plan is a success: America's economic recovery is restored and Japan's military offensive is forestalled by the second phase of the Japanese offensive: an economic attack. The Japanese hope that America will be too distracted to quickly respond to Japan’s military actions. Japan also attempts to assassinate the chairman of the Federal Reserve, but their target survives the attempt with a broken back. The book ends with Ryan returning to the United States to lead a successful military campaign against the Soviet Union in World War II. It is published by Simon & Schuster at a price of $24.99.

92,Tunnel in the Sky,"Rod Walker is a high school student who dreams of becoming a professional colonist. The final test of his Advanced Survival class is to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days. On test day, each student walks through the Ramsbotham portal and finds him or herself alone on a strange planet. After nearly two years of isolation, the survivors experience the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult, by reversing the process abruptly -- each of the students goes from being a personally self-responsible member of an autonomous community back to being a youth with little authority or responsibility in the home culture. Rod is briefly depicted accomplishing his heart's desire; the novel's ending finds him preparing to lead a formal colonization party to another planet. The last advice the students receive is to ""watch out for stobor."" On the second day, Rod is ambushed and knocked unconscious by a thief. When he wakes up, all he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage. Eventually he teams up with Jacqueline ""Jack"" Daudet, a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male. When she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact, he realizes that they are stranded. They start recruiting others for the long haul and Rod becomes the de facto leader of a community that eventually grows to around 75 people. He is subsequently put back in charge. Heinlein tracks the social development of this community of educated Westerners deprived of technology, followed by its abrupt dissolution when contact with Earth is reestablished. All of theStudents go back willingly except for Rod, who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small, but sovereign state to a teenager casually brushed aside by the adult rescuers. Despite disagreeing with many of Grant's policies, Rod supports him. Rod's teacher also informs Rod that his warning against ""stobor"" (""robots"" spelled backwards) was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet - to instill fear and caution in the students. Rod has no taste for politics or administration, and is happy to have Grant Cowper, an older college student and born politician, elected ""mayor"". Grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done. When a species previously thought harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through their camp, the settlement is devastated and Grant is killed. When Grant ignores Rod's warning that they're living in a dangerously hard-to-defend location and that they should move to a cave system he has found."
93,The Mismeasure of Man,"The Mismeasure of Man is a critical analysis of the early works of scientific racism about the supposed, biologically inherited (genetic) basis for human intelligence. Gould proposed that most psychological studies have been heavily biased, by the belief that the human behavior of a race of people is best explained by genetic heredity. He said that if the genetic heritability of IQ were demonstrable within a given racial or ethnic group, it would not explain the causes of IQ differences among the people of a group, or if said IQ differences can be attributed to the environment. As an evolutionary biologist and historian of science, Gould accepted biological variability, but opposed biological determinism, which posits that genes determine a definitive, unalterable social destiny for each man and each woman in life and society. Gould said that it is very difficult to conceive of a world wherein every man and woman grew up in the same environment, because spatial dispersion upon the planet Earth makes it impossible. Furthermore he dismissed the proposition of randomness, because of the randomness of molecular and genetic development of a given population, given a given genotype and given a population given a certain age. Gould also said that correlation does not imply causation; in example, he said that the measures of the changes, over time, in ""my age, the population of México, the price of Swiss cheese, my pet turtle’s weight, and the average distance between galaxies"" have a high, positive correlation — yet that correlation doesn't indicate that Gould’S age increased because the Mexican population increased. More specifically, a. high correlation between the intelligence quotients of a parent and a child can be presumed either as evidence that IQ is genetically inherited, or thatIQ is inherited through social and environmental factors. Gould: ""If all environments were to become equal for everyone, all remaining differences in IQ would necessarily be 100 percent genetic in origin"", which is misleading, at best, and false, at worst, and a false proposition at worst. He also said the data from IQ tests can be applied to arguing the logical validity of either proposition — genetic inheritance and environmental inheritance — the psychometric data have no inherent value. The evolutionary biologist Richard Lewontin, a colleague of Gould's, is a proponent of said argument in relation to the cognitive ability tests that determine a person's intelligence quotient. Gould describes Morton's rather imprecise technique of filling skulls with bird seed to obtain endocranial-volume data and how Morton had probably pushed down bird seed in the white skulls so that they had more volume."
94,The Picture of Dorian Gray,"Dorian Gray is a young man who believes beauty is the only worthwhile aspect of life. Under the influence of Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian begins to explore his senses. He discovers amazing actress Sibyl Vane, who performs Shakespeare plays in a dingy theatre. Dorian rejects her, saying her beauty was in her acting, and he is no longer interested in her. When he returns home, he notices that his portrait has changed. He takes Basil to the portrait, which is as hideous as Dorian's sins. He blames Basil for his fate and stabs Basil to death. He then blackmails an old friend named Alan Campbell, a chemist, into destroying Basil's body. Seeing this, he realizes that the motives behind his ""self-sacrifice"" were merely vanity, curiosity, and the quest for new emotional experiences. Deciding that only full confession will absolve him, he decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience. In a rage, he picks up the knife that killed Basil Hallward and plunges it into the painting. The servants find Dorian stabbed in the heart, stabbed and suddenly aged. It is only through the rings on his hand that the corpse can be identified, however, that the portrait has reverted to its original form. The title of the novel is never revealed in the novel, but at Oscar Wilde's trial he admitted that he had 'had in mind' Joris-Karl Huysmans's À Rebours ('Against Nature') Dorian tells Lord Henry that he will be good from now on, and has started by not breaking the heart of his latest innocent conquest named Hetty Merton. Lord Henry later informs him that she has killed herself by swallowing prussic acid. The novel ends with Dorian long gone, but a woman from the opium den chastises him for not killing Dorian, revealing Dorian has not aged for 18 years. The book was written in the first half of the 19th century and was published in the second half of that year. It has been described as a ""poisonous"" French decadence novel, a present from Lord Henry. The name of the book has not been revealed, but it is said to be a work of art by the French writer Jean-Francois Cousteau, who was a friend of Wilde's. It was published by Hodder & Stoughton, a division of Penguin Books, and is available in English and French."
95,The Book of the City of Ladies,"The City of Ladies is a book written by Christine in the thirteenth century. In it, Christine tries to understand why men slander women. The three Virtues, Lady Reason, Lady Rectitude and Lady Justice, appear to Christine. They help Christine build the walls of the city and teach her about the merits of women. Part III marks Lady Justice’s joining with Christine to “add the finishing touches” to the city, including bringing a queen to rule the city. At the close of this part, Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of theCity of Ladies.

96,The Sentinel,"The story deals with the discovery of an artifact on Earth's Moon left behind eons ago by ancient aliens. The object is made of a polished mineral and tetrahedral in shape, and is surrounded by a spherical forcefield. The narrator hypothesises that this ""sentinel"" was left on the moon as a ""warning beacon"" for possible intelligent and spacefaring species that might develop on Earth. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the operation of the sentinel is reversed. It is the energy of the sun, falling for the first time on the uncovered artifact, that triggers the signal that creatures from the Earth had taken the first step into space. The story ends on a cliffhanger, with the narrator saying: ""I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful thing as a moon. I've never seen a moon so full of stars and moonlight and stars and planets and all of that."" The story is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99, with a print run of 1,000 copies.

97,The Fountains of Paradise,"In the 22nd century, Dr Vannevar Morgan is a famous structural engineer. He hopes to develop the'space elevator' from a theoretical concept to reality. The only suitable starting point for the elevator lies at the summit of a mountain in Taprobane occupied by an ancient order of Buddhist monks, who implacably oppose the plan. A short epilogue envisages Earth many centuries later, after the sun has cooled and Earth has been depopulated, with humans now living on the terraformed inner planets. Several space elevators lead to a giant ""circumterran"" space station that encircles Earth at geostationary altitude. Several years later, the Earth-based tower is well under construction and travel up and down &mdash; both for tourists and for transfer to rocket ships &MDash; is being trialled. Despite his rapidly failing health, Morgan asserts his right to travel up the tower in a one-man'spider' to rescue them. He nearly fails, with limited battery power, but ultimately succeeds in reaching the chamber. As Morgan surveys the progress of his brainchild, his heart disease claims his life. The analogy with a wheel is evident: the space station itself is the wheel rim, Earth is the axle, and the six equidistant space elevator the spokes. A theme earlier explored in Clarke's novel The Sands of Mars is also explored in this novel.

98,Lord of the Flies,"A British plane crashes onto an isolated island in a remote region of the Pacific Ocean. The only survivors are male children below the age of 13. Two boys, the fair-haired Ralph and an overweight, bespectacled boy nicknamed ""Piggy"" find a conch, which Ralph uses as a horn to bring all the survivors to one area. Ralph emerges as one of the survivors' leaders, as does Jack Merridew, a member of a boys' choir that survived the crash. Jack organises his choir group into a hunting party responsible for discovering a food source. Ralph, Jack, and a boy named Simon soon form a troika of leaders. The tribe, which receives recruits from the main group of boys, grows in strength and begins to adopt customs common to primitive cultures, including face paint and bizarre rituals including sacrifices to the beast. When the tribe grows to a size that rivals Ralph's, they begin to harass those who remain at the shelters and make pronouncements encouraging them to abandon Ralph and the societal order he has imposed. Raiding Ralph's camp, the savages confiscate the glasses and return to their abode near the great rock heap called Castle Rock. Turning against Ralph, the tribe demands that they return the valuable object and return it to Ralph, who is forced to give up his position as ""chief"" The film ends with Ralph and Piggy, accompanied by Sam and Eric, confronting Jack and his band of ""savages"" in the island's interior during a dance and telling the boys that they should possess Piggy's glasses, the only means of starting a fire on the island.

99,Through the Looking-Glass,"Alice is playing with a white kitten and a black kitten when she ponders what the world is like on the other side of a mirror's reflection. Climbing up on the fireplace mantel, she pokes at the wall-hung mirror behind the fireplace and discovers, to her surprise, that she is able to step through it to an alternative world. In this reflected version of her own house, she finds a book with looking-glass poetry, ""Jabberwocky"", whose reversed printing she can read only by holding it up to the mirror. She also observes that the chess pieces have come to life, though they remain small enough for her to pick up. The Red Queen reveals to Alice that the entire countryside is laid out in squares like a gigantic chessboard, and offers to make Alice a queen if she can move all the way to the eighth rank/row in a chess match. Alice is placed in the second rank as one of the White Queen's pawns, and begins her journey across the chessboard by boarding a train that literally jumps over the third row and directly into the fourth rank, acting on the rule that pawns can advance two spaces on their first move. After crossing yet another brook into the sixth rank, Alice immediately encounters Humpty Dumpty, who, besides celebrating his unbirthday, provides his own translation of the strange terms in ""J Jabberwockingy"" before his inevitable fall. In the final chapter, the March Hare and Hatter of the first book make a brief re-appearance in the guise of ""Anglo-Saxon messengers"" called ""Haigha"" and ""Hattai"" ""Hare"" and ""Hatter"" are only given as other than John Tenniel's illustrations to their identities. Lewis's self-deprecating joke about the ""eccentric"" movements of chess knights may also be interpreted as a joke about Carroll's own physical stammering and awkwardness in real life. The Knight recites a long poem of his own composition, repeatedly falling off his horse and repeatedly falls off his own horse. The Lion and Unicorn are accompanied by the White King along with the Lion and the Unicorn, who again proceed to act out a nursery rhyme by fighting each other. After leaving the forest to their fight, the Red Knight reaches the seventh rank and takes Alice into the territory of their territory of the forest, where he is intent on capturing the ""white pawn"""
100,Waiting for Godot,"Waiting for Godot follows a pair of men who divert themselves while waiting expectantly, vainly for someone named Godot to arrive. To occupy the time they eat, sleep, converse, argue, sing, play games, exercise, swap hats, and contemplate suicide – anything ""to hold the terrible silence at bay"" The play opens with Estragon struggling to remove a boot, muttering, ""Nothing to be done."" His friend Vladimir takes up the thought and muses on it, the implication being that nothing is a thing that has to be do and this pair is going to have to spend the rest of the play doing it. The motif recurs throughout the play, particularly in relation to the two thieves crucified alongside Jesus, and that only one of the Four Evangelists mentions that one of them was saved. It may be linked to its putative central theme of the search for and reconciliation with God, as well as salvation: ""We're saved!"" they cry on more than one occasion when they feel that Godot may be near. The pair cannot agree on whether or not they are in the right place or that this is the arranged day for their meeting with Godot; they are not even sure what day it is. Their waiting is interrupted by the passing through of Pozzo and his heavily-laden slave Lucky, who has a rope tied around his neck. Pozzo barks orders at his slave and frequently calls him a ""pig"", but is civil towards the other two. They mistake him at first forGodot and clearly do not recognise him for the self-proclaimed personage he is. This irks him, but, while maintaining that the land that they are on is his, he acknowledges that ""the road is free to all"". Deciding to ask for a chance to rest, he casts the bones aside and jumps at them, much to the embarrassment of them, but is told that they belong to him. At the original pairing, Vladimir takes to the task regarding his slave, but his protestations are ignored. At least not unless he is prevailing on him to do something else, which he refuses to do. When Lucky hangs his head, Vladimir tries to mollify him, refusing to prevent him from selling him as a ""no"", but he only refuses to answer. The diversion ends as Estragons announces that they still have nothing to do, and the play ends. The original pairing tries to find out why Lucky does not put down his load (at least unless he does not want to be sold) but he refuses."
101,The Wanderer,"The novel is set in a future a few decades ahead of the 1960s, when it was written. A new planet appears out of nothing close to the Moon, shortly after a total lunar eclipse. Over a period of few days the planet appears to consume the Moon. On Earth, the new planet's gravity causes death and destruction as it raises huge ocean tides and causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The novel follows the lives of people around the globe, including a man attempting a solo crossing of the Atlantic ocean, a smuggler operating off the coast of Vietnam, two friends in England, a trio of drug addicts in New York City, and the military controllers of the USA Moon mission, deep in a bunker somewhere near Washington DC. The new planet is referred to by everybody as simply ""the Wanderer"". The main protagonists are three longtime friends, Paul Hagbolt, Margo Gelhorn (and her cat, Miaow) and Don Merriam, one of the American astronauts at the Moon base. They must avoid tsunamis, more earthquakes, roving mobs and flying saucers to survive. They meet a being calling itself Tigerishka, a large, female telepathic feline creature. They belong to a culture that spans the Universe, has achieved immortality, and can construct planets and traverse hyperspace. However they are fleeing their culture's police. Their culture rejects nonconformists, instead devoting itself to ensuring that intelligent life survives to the end of time. Their flight has brought them to Earth orbit simply to refuel. Huge amounts of matter must be converted to energy to power their hyperspace drive and their weapons. In the final scene, both planets take place, both disappear, and a battle takes place between the Wanderer and the Earth. A second planet, colored a dull gray where the Stranger is bright purple and yellow, appears and threatens the good treatment they have seen along with thousands of other humans by some kind of holographic projection. Paul and Don are evacuated in Don's ship, placed into a position close to Earth, and taken to Vandenberg Spaceport. TigerishKA takes Miaow with her back to her planet, where she is reunited with Paul aboard her ship. Now they must testify in the Wanderers' trial, for the police have arrived and threaten them with good treatment, along with other humans appearing by holographic projections. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book."

A joint Soviet-American crew, including Heywood Floyd from 2001, arrives to investigate the monolith in orbit around the planet. A sequence of scenes follows the explorations of David Bowman, who has been transformed into a non-corporeal, energy-based life-form. In the novel, the aliens are using Bowman as a probe to learn about humankind. He then returns to the Jupiter system to explore beneath the ice of Europa, where he finds aquatic life-forms. By this time, the Europans have evolved into a species that has developed into a primitive civilization. They regard Jupiter as their primary Sun, referring to ours as ""The Cold Sun"" The book ends with a brief epogue, which takes place in AD 20001, which is still facing the Farside hemisphere from which some have begun to explore the Sun, which they refer to as ""Lucifer"" The novel is published by Simon & Schuster, priced at $24.99 (hardcover) and $26.99 (£16.99) in the U.S., and is available for pre-order on Amazon.com, with a free download of the book for the Kindle version for $12.99.

103,Brave New World,"The novel opens in London in 632 (AD 2540 in the Gregorian Calendar) The vast majority of the population is unified under the World State, an eternally peaceful, stable global society in which goods and resources are plentiful. Natural reproduction has been done away with and children are created, 'decanted' and raised in Hatcheries and Conditioning Centres. All children are educated via the hypnopaedic process, which provides each child with caste-appropriate subconscious messages. The need for transcendence, solitude and spiritual communion is addressed with the ubiquitous availability and universally endorsed consumption of the drug soma. The maxim ""everyone belongs to everyone else"" is repeated often, and the idea of a ""family"" is considered pornographic. Sexual competition and emotional, romantic relationships are rendered obsolete because they are no longer needed. Marriage, natural birth, parenthood, pregnancy and pregnancy are considered obscene to be casual conversation. Spending alone is considered an outrageous waste of time and money, and wanting to be an individual is horrifying. The conditioning system eliminates the need for professional competitiveness; people are literally bred to do their jobs within their castes. There is no competition within the castes; there is no desire to do another job, and no one has no family, they have no ties to mourn to mourn. The book is an allusion to a mythical drink of the same name consumed by ancient Indo-Aryans. In the book, soma is a hallucinogen that takes users on enjoyable, hangover-free ""holidays"". It was developed by the World state to provide these inner-directed personal experiences within a socially managed context of State-run'religious' organizations; social clubs. The few women who can reproduce are conditioned to use birth control, even wearing a ""Malthusian belt"" (which resembles a cartridge belt and holds ""the regulation supply of contraceptives"") as a popular fashion accessory. The novel ends on a cliffhanging cliffhanger, with the reader left with no choice but to read the next book in the series, which is due to be published in the spring of 2015. It will be published by Simon & Schuster at a price of £16.99 ($24.99) and will be available in hardback, paperback, e-book, Kindle and audiobook. The author has no plans to self-publish the book and has no immediate plans to release it. It has been described as a ""futile"" work of fiction."
104,Aeneid,"The Aeneid can be divided into two halves based on the disparate subject matter of Books 1–6 (Aeneas' journey to Latium in Italy) and Books 7–12 (the war in Latium) These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil's ambition to rival Homer by treating both the Odyssey's wandering theme and the Iliads warfare themes. Virgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme (Arma virumque cano&nbsp;..., ""I sing of arms and of a man&ngt;..."") and an invocation to the Muse. He then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story: the resentment held by the goddess Juno against the Trojan people. This is consistent with her role throughout the Homeric epics. In the manner of Homer, the story proper begins in medias res, with the Trojan fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, heading in the direction of Italy. The fleet, led by Aeneas, is on a voyage to find a second home. It has been foretold that in Italy, he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations. He tells of how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean. After getting outside Troy, he goes back for his wife and appears before him and tells him that his destiny is to found Rome. He also recounts sadly the events which occasioned the Trojans' fortuitous arrival. He begins the tale shortly after the events described in theIliad. The Trojan fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa. There, Aenees's mother, Venus, in the form of a hunting woman very similar to the goddess Diana, encourages him and telling him the history of the city. Eventually, he seeks and gains the favor of Dido, Queen of Carthage, a city which has only recently been founded by refugees from Tyre and which will later become one of Rome's greatest imperial rivals and enemies. He escapes with his family with his escape with his son Ascanius, who had told him in a dream to flee with his fallen Trojan prince, to fend off tens of thousands of Greeks. The last Trojan general, Polydorus, tells him how he is to be found in Rome, where they encounter the general Harpy, who has been killed in the Battle of St. Helen's."
105,Paradise Lost,"The poem follows the epic tradition of starting in medias res (Latin for in the midst of things), the background story being recounted later. It begins after Satan and the other rebel angels have been defeated and banished to Hell, or (as it is also called in the poem), Tartarus. The story of Adam and Eve's temptation and fall is a fundamentally different, new kind of epic: a domestic one. In this manner, Milton portrays Adam as a heroic figure, but also as a greater sinner than Eve, as he is aware that what he is doing is wrong. The poem is separated into twelve ""books"" or sections, and the lengths of each book varies greatly (the longest being Book IX, with 1,189 lines) and the shortest Book VII, having 640. In 1674 a fully ""Revised and Augmented"" edition with a new division into twelve books was issued. This is the edition that is generally used today. The Arguments at the head of each books were added in subsequent imprints of the first edition. Adam is shown a vision by the angel Michael, in which Adam witnesses everything that will happen to mankind until the Great Flood. He is very upset by this vision of humankind's future, and so Michael also tells him about humankind's potential redemption from original sin through Jesus Christ (whom Michael calls ""King Messiah""). Adam and. Eve are cast out of Eden, and Michael says that Adam may find ""a paradise within thee, happier far"". Adam and Eden also now have a more distant relationship with God, who is omnipresent but invisible (unlike the tangible Father in the Garden of Eden). Adam is also shown to have lustful sex, and at first, Adam is convinced that Eve was right in thinking that eating the fruit would be beneficial. However, they soon fall asleep and have terrible nightmares, and after they awake, they experience guilt and shame for the first time. Realizing that they have committed a terrible act against God, they engage in mutual recrimination. Adam declares to Eve that since she was made from his flesh, they are bound to one another so that if she dies, he must also die. The final battle involves the Son of God single-handedly defeating the entire legion of angelic rebels and banishing them from Heaven. Following the purging of Heaven, God creates the World, culminating in his creation ofAdam and Eve. God gave them one explicit command: not to eat from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil on penalty of death."
106,The Merchant of Venice,"Bassanio, a young Venetian of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress Portia of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, Bassanio approaches his friend Antonio, a wealthy merchant of Venice and a kind and generous person, for three thousand ducats needed to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor - his ships and merchandise are busy at sea - he promises to cover a bond if Bassanios can find a lender. Shylock, who hates Antonio because of his Anti-Judaism and Antonio's customary refusal to borrow or lend money with interest, is at first reluctant, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. But finally agrees to lend Antonio the sum without interest upon the condition that if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, he may take a pound of Antonio's flesh. At Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea. This leaves him unable to satisfy the bond and he is brought before court. The climax of the play comes when the court of the Duke of Venice demands his pound of flesh from Antonio, twice the amount of the loan he had agreed to lend him. The Duke, wishing to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor who introduces himself as a young male ""doctor of the law"", bearing a recommendation of recommendation from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is actually Portia in disguise, and the clerk who accompanies her is actually Nerissa, also in disguise. Portia repeatedly asks the doctor to show mercy in a famous speech, advising him that mercy ""is blesteth twice"". However, the doctor takes that letter and gives him that letter, and that takes him to Venice, where he marries Portia. The play ends with Portia's father leaving a will stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets – one each of gold, silver and lead. If he picks the right casket, he gets Portia, and choses the lead casket to win her hand. The first suitor, the luxurious Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan: ""Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath"" The second suitor,. the conceited Prince of Arragon chooses the silver casket. Both suitors leave empty-handed."
107,The Invisible Man,"A mysterious stranger, Griffin, arrives at the local inn of the English village of Iping, West Sussex, during a snowstorm. The stranger wears a long-sleeved, thick coat and gloves, his face hidden entirely by bandages except for a fake pink nose, large goggles and a wide-brimmed hat. He is excessively reclusive, irascible, and unfriendly. He demands to be left alone and spends most of his time in his rooms working with a set of chemicals and laboratory apparatus, only venturing out at night. In the final chapter, it is revealed that Marvel has secretly kept Griffin's notes. Griffin's name is not known by anyone (including the reader) until then, he is referred to as the stranger or Invisible Man. The Invisible Man is Griffin, a former medical student who left medicine to devote himself to optics. He recounts how he invented medicine capable of rendering bodies invisible and, on an impulse, performed the procedure on himself. He tells of how he tries the invisibility on a cat, then himself. Griffin burns down the boarding house he is staying in along with all his equipment he used to turn invisible to cover his tracks, but soon realizes he is ill-equipped to survive in the open. He attempts to steal food and clothes from a large store, but eventually he steals some clothing from a theatrical supply shop and heads to Iping to attempt to reverse the effect. But now that he imagines he can make Kemp his secret confederate, Griffin describes his plan to begin a ""Reign of Terror"" by using his invisibility to terrorize the nation. Griffin is seized, assaulted, and killed by a mob. He's naked, battered body gradually becomes visible as he dies. A local policeman shouts to covered his face with a sheet, then the book concludes. The novel's most charming aspects is its portrayal of small-town life in southern England, which the author knew from first-hand experience. The book concludes with a mysterious burglary occurs in the village. It is revealed in the last chapter that Griffin has run out of money and is trying to find a way to pay for his board and lodging. He takes shelter in a nearby house that turns out to belong to Dr. Kemp, his former acquaintance from medical school. Griffin shoots and kills a local policeman who comes to Kemp's aid, then breaks into Kemp's house. Kemp bolts for the town, where the local citizenry comes to his aid. Griffin fights his way out and the next day leaves a note announcing that Kemp himself will be the first man to be killed."
108,Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,"In 1866, a mysterious sea monster, theorized by some to be a giant narwhal, is sighted by ships of several nations. The United States government assembles an expedition in New York City to track down and destroy the menace. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a noted marine biologist and narrator of the story, is issued a last-minute invitation to join the expedition, and he accepts. Canadian master harpoonist Ned Land and AronNax's faithful assistant Conseil are also brought on board. The expedition sets sail from Brooklyn aboard a naval ship called the Abraham Lincoln, which travels down around the tip of South America and into the Pacific Ocean. After much fruitless searching, the monster is found, and the ship charges into battle. During the fight, the ship's steering is damaged and the three protagonists are thrown overboard. They find themselves stranded on the ""hide"" of the creature, only to discover to their surprise that it is a large metal construct. They are quickly captured and brought inside the vessel, where they meet its enigmatic creator and commander, Captain Nemo. The rest of the book follows the adventures of the protagonists aboard the submarine, the Nautilus, which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas free of any land-based government. Their travels take them to numerous points in the world's oceans, some of which were known to Jules Verne from real travelers' descriptions and guesses, while others are completely fictional. The travelers witness the real corals of the Red Sea, the wrecks of the battle of Vigo Bay, the Antarctic ice shelves, and a fictional submerged Atlantis. Near the end of the novel, the submarine is tracked and attacked by a mysterious ship from that nation. This gives the three prisoners an opportunity to escape; they make it back to land alive, but the fate of the captain and his crew is not revealed. It is suggested that the captain exiled himself from the world after an encounter with his oppressive country somehow affected his family. The submarine is equipped to carry out cutting-edge marine biology research; he also tells his new passengers that he can never leave because he is afraid they will betray his existence to the world. Nemo attacks the ship under the waterline, sending it to the bottom of the ocean with all crew aboard as Aron nax watches from the salon. The story ends when the submarine enters a whirlpool off the coast of Norway and is attacked by the Moskenstraumen, more commonly known as the ""Maelstrom"""
109,Keep the Aspidistra Flying,"Gordon Comstock has 'declared war' on what he sees as an 'overarching dependence' on money. Comstock lives in a bedsit in London and earns enough to live, without luxuries, in a small bookshop. He is simultaneously content with his meagre existence and also disdainful of it.

112,The Myth of Sisyphus,"The essay is dedicated to Pascal Pia and is organized in four chapters and one appendix. Camus undertakes to answer what he considers to be the only question of philosophy that matters: Does the realization of the meaninglessness of life necessarily require suicide? He begins by describing the absurd condition: much of our life is built on the hope for tomorrow yet tomorrow brings us closer to death and is the ultimate enemy. In the last chapter, Camus outlines the legend of Sisyus who defied the gods and put the gods in chains so that no human needed to die. When it came time for Sisyu to die, he concocted a deceit which let him escape from the underworld. But both The Diary and The Karamazovovov find a path to hope and faith and thus fail as absurd creations, he writes. The absurd man gains freedom in a very concrete sense: no longer bound by hope for a better future or eternity, without a need to pursue life's purpose or to create meaning. ""What counts is not the best living but the most living,"" Camus writes in his last novel, The Possessed and The Diary of a Writer, in which he analyzes Dostoyevsky's The Writer, The Writer and the Writer, as absurd creators and works of art. ""If the world were clear, art would not exist,"" he writes, ""and art would also refrain from judging and from alluding to even the slightest shadow of the shadow of even the smallest shadow of doubt"" He concludes by saying that the absurd man must embrace all that the unreasonable world has to offer: ""Everything is permitted' ""is not an outburst of relief or of joy, but rather a bitter acknowledgment of a fact"" ""There is no noble love but that which recognizes itself to be both short-lived and exceptional,"" says Camus. ""In those three hours he travels the whole course of the dead-end path that the man in the audience takes a lifetime to cover,"" he says of Don Juan, the serial seducer who lives the passionate life to the fullest. ""He demonstrates to what degree appearing creates being,"" says the actor, who depictsEphemeral lives for ephemeral fame, ""he enjoys a freedom with regard to common rules"" ""In the end, no ethical rules apply, as they are all based on higher powers or on justification,"" writes Camus in the final chapter of the essay. ""Integrity has no need of rules."""
113,Cymbeline,"Imogen (or Innogen), daughter of the British king Cymbeline, is in love with Posthumus Leonatus, a man raised in her father's court. The two have secretly married, exchanging jewellery as tokens: a ring from Imogen, a bracelet from PostHumus. Cymbelines' wife the Queen is conspiring to have Cloten, her cloddish and arrogant son by an earlier marriage, married to Imogen. The Queen also is plotting to murder both Imogen and Cymeline to secure Clotan's kingship. Imogen adopts the name ""Fidele,"" meaning ""faithful,"" and leaves court to find food in a cave. The three men enter their cave and find young men who are captivated by Imogen's beauty, and the men are met outside the cave by the men's father, Belarius, a courtier banished as a traitor for supposedly conspiring with the Romans. The cave is his home to his ""sons"" Belarius and Polydorewal, whom he raised into great woods, who do not know their origin, but are nevertheless possessed of royal passion and heartiness. After a brief fight, Guiderius kills Clotens, who cuts off his head and cuts off the face of his head, and cuts his head off with a sword. The men are then taken to a cave to eat, and are met by the young men, who are also captivating by ""hishishe"" beauty, who eat them too. The young men then leave the cave and go home to their fathers, where they are raised in the great woods. The boys are later taken to Italy to live with their father, Caius Lucius, a Roman ambassador, who is on his way to demand the tribute that Cymbline, under the influence of his wife theQueen, has stopped paying.

115,Northanger Abbey,"Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman. By the age of 17 she is ""in training for a heroine"" She is excessively fond of reading Gothic novels of which Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho is a favourite. Catherine is invited by her wealthier neighbours in Fullerton, the Allens, to accompany them to visit the town of Bath and partake in the winter season of balls, theatre and other social delights. She is soon introduced to a clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, with whom she dances and converses. Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the Thorpes and the Tilneys, though John Thorpe continuously tries to sabotage her relationship with the Tilney. Catherine decides that, since General Tilney does not now seem to be affected by the loss of his wife, he may have murdered her or even imprisoned her in her chamber. She leaves, fearing that she has lost Henry's entire regard in regard to Real Life. Catherine comes to believe that, though their novels may be delightful, their everyday life does not relate to everyday life. The Tilneys are shocked and Catherine is terribly disappointed, realizing what a dishonest person they are. The General goes off to London and becomes less inhibited, becoming less inhibited and less dishonest. Catherine flees, sure that she will be punished. Catherine becomes a country parson's living of a modest sum, 400 pounds annually, which she may have in two and a half years. The couple must wait until that time to marry. Isabella and James become engaged. James departs to purchase a ring, and John accompanies him after coyly suggesting marriage to the oblivious Catherine. Catherine sneaks back to Mrs. Tilney's rooms, to discover that her overactive imagination has once again led her astray, as nothing is strange or distressing in the rooms at all. Unfortunately, Henry joins her in the corridor and questions why she is there. He guesses her surmises and inferences, and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death. Catherine cannot understand her friend's behavior, but Henry understands all too well, as he knows his brother's character and habits. Catherine learns that the house includes a mysterious suite of rooms that no one ever enters; they were Mrs. tilney's, who died nine years earlier. Catherine realizes that she had been crying, fearing how foolish, she had had beenizing how foolish she was."
116,Amadeus,"Shaffer has extensively revised his play, including changes to plot details. At the opening of the tale, Salieri is an old man, convinced he used poison to assassinate Mozart. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of getting back at his Creator. The play ends with Salieri attempting suicide in a last attempt to be remembered, leaving a false confession of having murdered Mozart with arsenic. He survives, however, and his confession is disbelieved by all, leaving him to wallow once again in mediocrity. A major theme in Amadeus is Mozart's repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic ""public"" with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy's own inability to appreciate Mozarts genius. On more than one occasion it is only the direct intervention of the Emperor himself that allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes, and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened). Salieri also humiliates Mozart’s wife when she comes to Salieri for aid, and smears his character with the Emperor and the court. On one occasion the Emperor intervenes on Salieri's behalf, allowing him to stop Mozart from killing his wife. On another occasion, the Emperor allows Salieri to kill Mozart, and Salieri then takes credit for it. The following is common to all revisions of Shaffer's play, with the exception of a few minor changes to the plot that have been made since the original run of the play in the 1970s and 1980s. The original version of this article referred to the play as ""Amadeus"" and referred to it as ""The Death and Life of Mozart"" This version of the story has been updated to make it clear that the play is in fact called ""The death and life of Mozarts"" and refers to the composer as ""Mozart"". The play is also referred to as the ""Death and Life Of Mozart"", and is referred to by Shaffer as ""Salieri"""
117,The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"The Mariner's tale begins with his ship departing on its journey. Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south off course by a storm and eventually reaches Antarctica. An albatross appears and leads them out of the Antarctic but the Mariner shoots the bird. This arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship ""from the land of mist and snow"" The ship encounters a ghostly vessel, on board are Death (a skeleton) and the ""Night-mare Life-in-Death"" (a deathly-pale woman) Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-In-Death the life of the Mariners, a prize she considers more valuable. One by one, all of the ship's crew members die, but theMariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the corpses. Eventually, the Mar Miner's curse is temporarily lifted when he sees sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as ""slimy things"" earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them. After the story, he leaves, and the next morning he wakes up ""a sad and wiser man"" The Mariner stops a man who is on the way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience and fear to fascination as the story progresses. Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create either a sense of danger, of the supernatural or of serenity, depending on the mood of each of the different parts of the poem. The poem is written in the language style of the poet Samuel L. M. Coontz, who is known for his use of the vernacular  poem form and  the  synthetic narrative form of the English poet William Butler Yeats, who wrote the first edition of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in 1815. The Mariners tale is about a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage and is driven by guilt to wander the earth, tell his story, and teach a lesson to those he meets. After relating the story to the Wedding- guest, the story ends and the man goes home, and wakes up the next day ""a wiser and a sad and a wiser man"". The poem ends with the words: ""For the dear God who made and love us, both great and small, who love all things small; : For the dear and small who love us all, both big and small"""

119,The Great Hunt,"The prologue shows how deep Ba'alzamon's influence has gone, even in places the protagonists believe to be safe. The protagonists rest at Fort Fal Dara in Shienar, where the White Tower’s Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, visits. Siuan tells Rand that he is the Dragon Reborn, which Rand denies. Rand, Loial and Hurin are separated from the Shienaran party and transported to an alternate world via a portal stone. Rand suspects that he activated the portal stone by unconsciously channeling saidin in his sleep, although Egwene dreams that a mysterious woman is responsible. Rand and Loial are attacked by trollocs and, during their escape, destroy the Chapter House of the Illuminator's Guild, a society of people who are extremely protective of their knowledge of fireworks. The Horn and dagger are once again lost. With the aid of Perrin, Ingtar's group is successfully reunited with Rand, and they learn that the Horn has been taken to Toman Head, at the port city of Falme. As these events unfold, action also takes place on the other side of the continent of Falcloak where the invading Seanchan beasts have occupied Falme and their exotic side is preparing to attack the Whitecloak Tower. Nynaeve al'Meara and EgWene al'Vere accompany Moraine to Tar Valon for Aes Sedai training. Later on, Rand finds gleeman Thom Merrilin, whom he thought dead after an encounter with a myrddraal in The Eye of the World. Rand is able to use the Stone to return to their own world, albeit much farther ahead than either Fain's or Ingtars group. Rand's struggle to accept his channeling ability is a recurring element in the novel. When they arrive in Falme, Min is captured by the Seanchan and is collared with a device used by Seanchan to control women who can channel the Light. At Atme, Rand and Elayne escape, but Rand and Min, along with Min, travel with her toToman Head via the Waygate. They arrive with Elayne and escape, and Rand and his friends are in danger, but they arrive with her with her and her children. Rand al'Thor meets Siuan. He is at a loss to explain Rand's disappearance, but Perrin pretends to be another sniffer like Hurin, but secretly uses his wolf senses to smell and track and also ask nearby wolves which way Padan Fain’S group went."
120,A Crown of Swords,"Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, prepares to attack the Forsaken Sammael in Illian. Egwene al'Vere and Siuan Sanche attempt to manipulate the Aes Sedai rebels in Salidar.

121,Winter's Heart,"The events of Winter's Heart take place simultaneously with the events of the next book, Crossroads of Twilight. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, is bonded as a Warder by Elayne Trakand, Aviendha, and Min Farshaw. Mat Cauthon, making his return to the series after his absence in the previous book, is trapped in the city of Ebou Dar in Altara, which is under Seanchan occupation. In Knife of Dreams, it has been confirmed that saidin is clean, by both Aes Sedai and Asha'man. However, according to Jordan himself, though sane channelers no longer need to fear its destructive effects, it does not restore any already affected by it to their former selves. It has also resulted in the utter destruction of the female Choedan Kal and its access key, which triggered the mass suicide of Amayar along the Sea Folk Islands. The forces of light under Cadsuane split into several groups to be ready for the upcoming attack. The former Damane Alivia fought without being linked, helped by a set of Angreal and Ter'angreal presumably made for battle. Nesune, Beldeine, Daigian linked with Jahar (one of Merise's warders, wielding Callandor) Verin and Kumira linked with a Sea Folk Windfinder Shalon. Osan'garal and Graendal (formerly Aorgin) masquerading as Corlan Dashiva an Asha'rean, killed by Elza (ironically a Black Ajahwil) Eben Hopwil (formerly Lanfear) was killed by Gra endal and Aran'Garal by Gra Endal. It is also believed that the giant statue of Balthien is the signal of the end of the Age of Illusion. The book ends on a cliffhanger, leading to a battle between the forces of the Light and the Shadow. It was written in the same style as the first two books in the series, with many of the major events taking place at the beginning of the book and the middle of it. The final book of the series will be written in a different style, and will be published in the spring of 2015. The last book will be released in the summer of 2015, and is expected to be the last of the books in this series. It will also be the first book in a series of three."

126,A Streetcar Named Desire,"Blanche DuBois is a fading, but still-attractive, Southern belle. Her pretensions to virtue and culture only thinly mask alcoholism and delusions of grandeur. The character of Blanche is thought to be based on Williams' sister Rose Williams who struggled with her mental health and became incapacitated after a lobotomy. In the closing moments, Blanche utters her signature line to the kindly doctor who leads her away: ""Whoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers"" The reference to the streetcar named Desire is symbolic. Blanche not only has to travel on a streetcar route named ""Desire"" to reach Stella's home on ""Elysian Fields"" but her desire acts as an irrepressible force throughout the play. In their final confrontation, it is implied that Stanley rapes Blanche, resulting in her nervous breakdown. The play ends with Blanche's would-be suitor, Harold ""Mitch"" Mitchell, getting trampled in their path. It is thought that the play is based on the life of Rose Williams, a woman who struggled to cope with the loss of her husband, Allan Grey, who committed suicide in the early 1960s. The show is directed by David Cromwell and is set in New Orleans in the 1970s and 1980s. For more information on the play, go to: http://www.theplaytimes.com/2013/01/28/27/the-play-and-the-life-of-blanche-duBois-in-new-orleans-by-samuel-cromwell-and.html#storylink=cpy. Theater-review: ""Blanche,"" by Samuel L. Cevallos, is published by Simon & Schuster, priced $24.99, with a limited run of $35.99.

The play is also available on DVD and Blu-ray, with an audio version of the play to be released later in the year."
127,The Queen of the Damned,"Each of the six chapters in Part One tells a different story about a different person or group of people. Several of the characters appear in the two previous books, including Armand, Daniel, Marius, Louis, Gabrielle and Santino. The Queen of the Damned, deals with the origins of vampires themselves. The mother of all vampires, Akasha, begins as a pre-Egyptian queen, in a land called Kemet (which will become Egypt), many thousands of years ago. In Part Five, the vampires leave Maharet's compound and assemble at Armand's resort, the Night Island, (according to Anne Rice, inspired by Fire Island) in Florida to recover. They eventually go their separate ways (as told in The Tale of the Body Thief). Lestat takes Louis to see David Talbot in London. After their brief visit with Talbot they depart into the night, an incensed Louis and his angry words filling Lest at with glee. The vampires eventually return to Armand and the rest of the vampires to their home in Florida, where they are reunited with their friends and family. They then return to New York to continue the story in the second book, Interview with the Vampire, which is due to be published in September. The third and fourth books will be published later this year, and the fifth and sixth will be released in October. The fifth book will be called The Vampire Queen and the Vampire King, and will be available in hardback and e-book. The sixth book, The Vampire King and The Vampire Princess, is expected to be released later in the year. It will be the first of a two-part series, with the first part focusing on the vampire queen Akasha and the twin sisters Maharet and her sister, Mekare. The last part of the series will focus on the vampires' relationship with each other, and on Akasha's plans to rule the world. It is also the first time the vampires have been seen in public since the first book was published. The book will also be the last of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. The series will be made into two films, the second of which will be The Vampire Chronicles, which will air on September 25, 2014. The film will be directed by Stephen King and is based on the book's events. The movie will be based on a series of dreams about red-haired twin sisters, and a fact that a powerful being is killing vampires around the world by means of spontaneous combustion."
128,Gulliver's Travels,"Lemuel Gulliver's Travels is a satire on the Court of Lilliput. The book is written in the style of books of the time. It is the last book Swift wrote for the Travels. The author was in Anglican holy orders and was likely to make such comparisons in the book. Swift was attacking reason and the deism movement in this book, the last one he wrote for The Travels. It was published in 1699 and is considered one of the most famous books of all time. The last book of the Travels was written in 1710 and published in 1711. It has been translated into English as ""The Travels of Lemuel GULLiver"" and ""Gulliver and the Travels of the Great Adventure"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, with a preamble by Samuel Johnson, is published by Macmillan, priced £12.99. The original version of this article stated that the author had written the book between 1699-1702. We are happy to clarify that this is not the case, and that the book was written between 1698 and 1702, when the author was living in England. We apologise for any confusion this may have caused, and we have been asked to make clear that this was the case. We would like to make it clear that, in fact, the book is about Lemuel's first voyage, and not his second or third. We regret that we have used the term 'travelling box' to refer to the book, and have asked that it be referred to as a 'traveling box' for the sake of clarity. We also apologise for the use of the word 'box' in the title of the book; we would prefer to use the term ‘traveller’s box’. We hope that this has not been perceived as a derogatory term for Lemuel, as it is in fact the name of the travelling box, which is used by the author in the rest of the books. We apologize for the confusion this has caused, as we would like it to be understood that the word ‘box’ means ‘traveler’, not ‘voyage’ or ‘trip.’ We would also like to point out that the title ‘Travelling Box’ is not a reference to a book, but to a series of short stories written by Lemuel in the 17th century about his travels."

130,A Midsummer Night's Dream,"The play features three interlocking plots, connected by a celebration of the wedding of Duke Theseus of Athens and the Amazon queen, Hippolyta. It is set simultaneously in the woodland and in the realm of Fairyland, under the light of the moon. In the opening scene, Hermia refuses to follow her father's, Egeus, instructions to marry Demetrius, whom he has chosen for her. At that same time, Peter Quince and his fellow players gather to produce a stage play, ""the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe"", for the Duke and the Duchess. Nick Bottom, who is playing the main role ofPyramus, is over-enthusiastic and wants to dominate others by suggesting himself for the characters of Thisbe, the Lion, and PyramUS at the same time. He would also rather be a tyrant and recites some lines of Ercles. Meanwhile, Oberon, king of the fairies, and his queen, Titania, have come to the forest outside Athens. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience, so he calls for his mischievous court jester Puck or ""Robin Goodfellow"" to help him apply a magical juice from a flower called ""love-in-idleness"" He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower so that he can make Titania fall in love with the first thing she sees when waking up, which he is sure will be an animal of the forest. He says, ""And ere I take this charm from off her sight, / As I can take it with another herb, / I'll make her render up her page to me."" Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay in the forest until she has attended Theseus and Hippolytta's wedding. When Bottom returns for his next lines, he transforms into a donkey. Determined to wait for his friends for his love, he begins to sing to Titania by singing to himself. Bottom is spotted by his friends and falls in love by Titania. The play ends in terror, much to Nick Bottom's confusion, since he hasn't felt a love for Titania since he was a child, and has to run in the other workmen screaming in terror in order to get to his friends' bower for their rehearsal. The next day, Nick Bottom and his friends venture into the forest to perform their play about Theseus' wedding."
131,The English Patient,"The historical backdrop for this novel is the Second World War in Northern Africa and Italy. Hana, a young Canadian Army nurse, lives in the abandoned Villa San Girolamo in Italy, which is filled with hidden, undetonated bombs. All she knows about her English patient is that he was burned beyond recognition in a plane crash before being taken to the hospital by a Bedouin tribe. The only possession that the patient has is a copy of Herodotus' histories that survived the fire. He has annotated these histories and is constantly remembering his explorations in the desert in great detail, but cannot state his own name. One day, while Hana is playing the piano, two British soldiers enter the villa. One of the soldiers is Kip, an Indian Sikh who has been trained as a sapper or combat engineer, specializing in bomb and ordnance disposal. Kip and the English Patient immediately become friends. Over time while Almásy divulges the details of his past, Kip becomes close to Hana. He becomes a part of a community again and begins to feel comfortable as a lover on the U.S. mainland. He also becomes a very skilled sapper at his job at Lord Suffolk's bomb disposal training facility in Westfield, New York.

He fell in love with Katharine Clifton, a British woman who accompanied the patient's desert exploration team. When World War II broke out in 1939, the members of the exploration team decided to pack up base camp, and Geoffrey Clifon offered to pick up the patient in his plane, and takes Katharine with him. Geoffrey turned around and crashes his plane in an effort to kill all three of them, revealing he had known about the affair. Geoffrey died immediately; Katharine survived, but was horribly injured."

When news of these events reaches Ravana, he resolves to destroy Rama by capturing Sita with the aid of the rakshasa Maricha, assuming the form of a golden deer, and killing Rama with the help of his brother Khara. After Rama's departure, king Dasharatha, unable to bear the grief, passes away. Meanwhile, Bharata refuses to profit from his mother's wicked scheming and visits Rama in the forest. He requests Rama to return and rule. But Rama, determined to carry out his father's orders to the letter, refuses to return before the period of exile. But Bharata carries Ramas's sandals, and keeps them on the throne, while he rules as Rama’s regent. After the war, Rama gets married to Sita, Lakshman a to Urmila. Bharata to Mandavi and Shatrughan to Shrutakirti. The weddings are celebrated with great festivity at Mithila, and the marriage party returns to Ayod Pradesh. The king was in possession of an immensely heavy bow, presented to him by the God Shiva: whoever could wield the bow could marry Sita. Only Rama wields the bow and breaks it. When Sita was of marriageable age, the king decided to have a swayamvara which included a contest. The battle was won by Rama. He is then crowned king. The story ends with the marriage of Sita and Bharata, and Rama becomes king of the land of Kshatriya. The book was written by Ravi Agrawal, who is also the author of the epic novel, The God's Scepter, about the life and death of the Hindu god Vishnu. It was first published in 16th century India and has since been republished by the Boudhredi Publication Company."
134,The Forge of God,"The novel features scenes and events including the discovery of a near-dead alien in the desert, who clearly says in English, ""I'm sorry, but there is bad news"" There is another alien faction at work, however, represented on Earth by small spider-like robots that recruit human agents through some form of mind control. They frantically collect all the human data, biological records, tissue samples, seeds, and DNA from the biosphere that they can, and evacuate a handful of people from Earth. In space, this faction's machines combat and eventually destroy the attackers, though not before Earth's fate is sealed. The evacuees eventually settle a newly terraformed Mars. Some form the crew of a Ship of the Law to hunt down the home world of the killers, a quest described in the sequel, Anvil of Stars. One of the point of view characters is Arthur Gordon, a scientist who, with his wife Francine and son Martin is among those rescued from the destruction of Earth. Some other characters are close to an American president who fails to take action against the threat. The two books show at least one solution to the Fermi paradox, with electromagnetically noisy civilisations being snuffed out by the arrival of self-replicating machines designed to destroy any potential threat to their (possibly long-dead) creators. (A similar theme is explored in Fred Saberhagen's Berserkers novels.) The novels are both published by Simon & Schuster and are available in hardback and e-book.

135,Blood Music,"In the novel, renegade biotechnologist Vergil Ulam creates simple biological computers based on his own lymphocytes. Faced with orders from his nervous employer to destroy his work, he injects them into his own body, intending to smuggle the 'noocytes' (as he calls them) out of the company and work on them elsewhere. Inside Ulam's body, the noocytes multiply and evolve rapidly, altering their own genetic material and quickly becoming self-aware. The nanoscale civilization they construct soon begins to transform Ulam, then others. Through infection, conversion and assimilation of humans and other organisms the cells eventually aggregate most of the biosphere of North America into a region seven thousand kilometres wide. This civilization, which incorporates both the evolved noocytes and recently-assimilated conventional humans, is eventually forced to abandon the normal plane of existence in favor of one in which thought does not require a physical substrate. The book's structure is titled ""inter-phase"", ""prophase"",'metaphase', ""anaphase"", ""telophase"" and ""interphase"" This mirrors the major phases of cell cycle: interphase and mitosis. The reason for the noocyte's inability to remain in this reality is somewhat related to the strong anthropic principle. The noocytes' inability to stay in thisreality is somewhatrelated to theStrong anthropic Principle. The books structure is called ""inter phase"", "" prophase,"" ""metaphASE"", "" anaphase,"" ""telophone"" and 'interphase."" This mirrors a major phase of the cell cycle, mitosis, which is called interphase. The novel is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99 (hardback) and £16 ( paperback).

136,The World According to Garp,"The story deals with the life of T. S. Garp. His mother, Jenny Fields, is a strong-willed nurse who wants a child but not a husband. She encounters a dying ball turret gunner known only as Technical Sergeant Garp who was severely brain damaged in combat. Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual autonomic sexual arousal. She uses Garp's sexual response to impregnate herself, and names the resultant son after him ""T. S."" (standing only for ""Technical Sergeant""). Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position at the all-boys school Steering School in New England. He grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction&mdash;three topics in which his mother has little interest. After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to Vienna where he writes his first novella. After they return to Steering Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach's daughter and founds his family, he a struggling writer, she a teacher of English. The publication of A Sexual Suspect makes his mother famous as she becomes a feminist icon as feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man. She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women who cut off their tongues in support of and named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut off by her rapists to silence her. The book contains some motifs that appear in almost all John Irving novels: bears, wrestling,. Vienna, New England, people who are uninterested in having sex, and a complex Dickensian plot that spans the protagonist's whole life. Adultery (another common Irving motif) also plays a large part, culminating in one of the novel's most harrowing and memorable scenes. There is also a tincture of another familiar Irving trope, castration anxiety, most obvious in the lamentable fate of Michael Milton. The story is decidedly rich with (in the words of the fictional GARP's teacher, ""lunacy and sorrow,"" and the sometimes ridiculous chains of events the characters experience still resonate with painful truth. The novel contains several framed narratives: Garp’s first novellas, The Pension Grillparzer; Vigilance, a short story; and the first chapter of his novel, The World According to Bensenhaver. GARP learns (often painfully) from the women in his life (including transsexual ex-football player Roberta Muldoon) struggling to become more tolerant in the face of intolerance."
137,Mutiny on the Bounty,"The novel tells the story through a fictional first-person narrator by the name of Roger Byam. Byam, although not one of the mutineers, remains with the Bounty after the mutiny. He subsequently returns to Tahiti, and is eventually arrested and taken back to England to face a court-martial. He and several other members of the crew are eventually acquitted. The novel is based on real-life crew member Peter Heywood, who was on the Bounty at the time of the incident in Tahiti in 1842.

138,The Mothman Prophecies,"The book combines Keel's account of his investigation into alleged sightings of a large, winged creature called Mothman in the vicinity of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, during 1966 and 1967 with his own theories about UFOs and various supernatural phenomena. It ultimately connects them to the December 15, 1967, collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River.

139,The Memory of Earth,"Humanity has lived for 40 million years on a planet called Harmony. The Oversoul is a computer left as guardian of this planet.

140,Sixth Column,"A top secret research facility hidden in the Colorado mountains is the last remaining outpost of the United States Army after its defeat by the PanAsians. The invaders are depicted as ruthless and cruel. The surviving scientists soon learn that they can selectively kill people by releasing the internal pressure of their cell membranes, among other things. Using this discovery they construct a race-selective weapon which will kill only Asians. They devise other uses for the awesome forces they have discovered, but how can a handful of men overthrow an occupation force that controls all communications and when it is a crime to print a word in English? The Americans set up a church of their own and begin acting as ""Priests of Mota"" (Mota is atom spelled backwards) in order to build a resistance movement.

141,The Puppet Masters,"""Sam"" is an agent in a secret U.S. government intelligence organization. He and another agent, Mary, are called in to investigate a report of a flying saucer landing in Iowa. They discover that the people are being brought under the mental control of repulsive, slug-like creatures that attach to their backs, just below the neck. They are unable to convince the President to stop a meticulously planned military counter-invasion of the heartland. Eventually the politicians realize the danger, and Sam and Mary are given leave. By this time, they have fallen in love and get married. Their idyll is interrupted when a slug takes over first his beloved pet cat, then Mary. Sam manages to push Mary onto a hot fire to kill the slug, leaving them both badly burned, but alive and free. For their part, the slugs drop all pretenses and openly wage war on their human hosts. A network of such interactions could spread rapidly among the invaders, who knew how valuable he is. Some scientists speculate that the slug is really just one organism in many bodies in many different bodies. The slugs are from Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. They can communicate by ""direct conference"", where they have him sit back and back to back and merge back to their hosts. They use animals such as horses, elephants, and even elephants as marked hosts. The slug is capable of fissioning in two fairly quickly. The number of infected humans must now be so large that any military action would kill tens of millions. The problem has reached a scale beyond their ability to influence it, and the problem has become a problem beyond their abilities to solve. It is revealed that the Old Man is Sam's father. The Old Man tracks Sam down and captures him, but Sam is able to escape. He is at first furious with Mary for entrapping him, and then with his boss, when he learns that his boss tricked Mary into it. He eventually becomes enslaved and escapes the agency. On a solo mission to Kansas City, Sam is shocked to discover the number of slugs is much greater than thought. Instead of taking over key people, they've absorbed the entire human population of the occupied territory. They have infected the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, whose department controls the President's personal security, and are a step away from infecting the President himself. By the time Sam recovers in hospital, anyone fully dressed is suspect. Sam is ready to quit, but when Mary volunteers, he gives in and does it himself."
142,Henry V,"The Chorus (a single actor) calls for a ""Muse of fire"" so that the actor playing King Henry can ""[ā]ssume the port [bearing] of Mars"" The early scenes deal with the embarkation of Henry's fleet for France, and include a real-life incident in which the Earl of Cambridge and two others plotted to assassinate Henry at Southampton. As with all of Shakespeare's serious plays, there are also a number of minor comic characters whose activities contrast with and sometimes comment on the main plot. The army also includes a Scot, an Irishman, an Englishman and Fluellen, a comically stereotyped Welsh soldier, whose name is an attempt at a phonetic rendition of ""Llywelyn"". The play also deals briefly with the death of Falstaff, Henry's estranged friend from the Henry IV plays, whom Henry remembers fondly. The action ends with the French king adopting Henry as his heir to the French throne and the prayer of the French queen ""that English may as French, French Englishmen, receive each other, God speak this Amen"" But before the curtain descends, the Chorus re-appears one more time and ruefully notes that Henry's own heir's ""state, so many had the managing, that they lost France and made his England bleed"" – a reminder of the tumultuous reign of Henry VI of England, which Shakespeare had previously brought to the stage in a trilogy of plays: Henry VI, Part 1, HenryVI, Part 2 and Henry VI,. Part 3. The Chorus appears again, seeking support for the English navy, and notes that ""the ambassador from the French comes back / Tells Harry that the king doth offer him / Katherine his daughter."" After the victory at Agincourt, Henry attempts to woo the French princess, Catherine of Valois. This is difficult because neither speaks the other's language well, but the humour of their mistakes actually helps achieve his aim. He agonizes about the moral burden of being king, noting that a king is only a man. Before the battle, Henry rallies his troops with the famous St. Crispin's Day Speech, referring to ""we few, we happy few,. we band of brothers"" The play ends with Henry's victory over the French and the end of the Hundred Years' War, with Henry as the new king of France. The play was first performed in London in 16th century, when Elizabethan stages did not use scenery."
143,The Wind in the Willows,"Mole, Rat and Badger are friends who live in the Wild Wood. Mole wants to meet Badger, but Rat refuses to take him, telling Mole to be patient and wait. Mole gets lost in the woods, sees many ""evil faces"" among the wood's less-welcoming denizens, succumbs to fright and panic and hides, trying to stay warm, amongst the sheltering roots of a tree. Rat, upon awakening and finding Mole gone, guesses his mission from the direction of Mole's tracks and, equipping himself with a pistol and a stout stick, goes in search, finding him as snow begins to fall in earnest. Badger learns from his visitors that Toad has crashed six cars, has been hospitalised three times, and has spent a fortune on fines. They resolve that once spring arrives they will make a plan to protect Toad from himself; they are, after all, his friends and are worried for his well-being. With the arrival of spring, Badger visits Mole and Rat to do something about Toad's self-destructive obsession. They decide to put Toad under house arrest, with themselves as the guards, until Toad changes his mind. Feozles the Water Rat at under house (who is on guard duty) and escapes. He steals a car, drives it recklessly and is sent to prison on a twenty-year sentence. Though he is sent back to prison, Toad is disguised as a Jailer's Daughter who helps him escape. He is pursued by the gullibility of his clothes and is pursued back upon being back upon his back. Meanwhile, Rat is cross with Rat for gullibility, but draw comfort from the fact that they need no longer waste their summer guarding their home in the hope that Toad may return in the summer. The three animals continue to live in Toad Hall in the hopes that Toad will return in summer. They hope that they will be able to help Toad return to his normal self.

144,The Hunting of the Snark,"The Baker recalls that his uncle once warned him that, though catching Snarks is all well and good, you must be careful. Along the way, the Butcher and Beaver -previously mutually wary for the Butcher's specialty in preparing beavers- become fast friends. The Barrister falls asleep and dreams of a court trial defended by the Snark, and the Banker loses his sanity after being attacked by a frumious Bandersnatch. At the end, the Baker calls out that he has found a Snark; but when the others arrive he has mysteriously disappeared. 'For the Snarks was a Boojum, you see', says the Baker, who had been hunting with his uncle, 'for his Snark was aBoojum' The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99 with a p&p of £12.99.

145,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"The book tells the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who is bored with the daily squabbles over food. Seized by a passion for flight, he pushes himself, learning everything he can about flying, until finally his unwillingness to conform results in his expulsion from his flock. An outcast, he continues to learn, becoming increasingly pleased with his abilities as he leads an idyllic life. One day, Jonathan is met by two gulls who take him to a ""higher plane of existence"" in that there is no heaven but a better world found through perfection of knowledge. He discovers that his sheer tenacity and desire to learn make him ""pretty well a one-in-a-million bird."" In this new place, Jonathan befriends the wisest gull, Chiang, who takes him beyond his previous learning, teaching him how to move instantaneously to anywhere else in the Universe. In this other society, real respect emerges as a contrast of the coercive force that was keeping the former ""Breakfast Flock"" together. The learning process, linking the highly experienced teacher and the diligent student, is raised into almost sacred levels, suggesting that this may be the true relation between human and God. Because of this, each has been described as believing that human andGod, regardless of the all immense difference, are sharing something of great importance that can bind them together. In the third part of the book are the last words of Jonathan's teacher: ""Keep working on love."" Through his teachings, Jonathan understands that the spirit cannot be really free without the ability to forgive, and that the way to progress leads—for him, at least—through becoming a teacher, not just through working hard as a student. Jonathan returns to the Breakfast Flock to share his newly discovered ideals and the recent tremendous experience, ready for the difficult fight against the current rules of that society. The idea that the stronger can reach more by leaving weaker friends behind seems totally rejected. Hence, love, respect, and all seem to be important to the freedom from the pressure to obey the rules just accepted because they are just accepted. ""Do you want to fly so much that you will forgive the Flock, and learn, and go back to them one day and work to help them know?"" Jonathan asks his first student, Fletcher Lynd Segull, before getting into any further talks. ""You have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way"""
146,I Am Legend,"Main character is Robert Neville, apparently the sole survivor of a pandemic whose symptoms resemble vampirism. The narrative details Neville's daily life in Los Angeles as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease, to which he is immune. Neville survives by barricading himself by sunset inside his house, further protected by garlic, mirrors, and crosses. After three years, Neville sees an apparently uninfected woman, Ruth, abroad in the daylight, and captures her. Ruth reluctantly allows him a blood sample but knocks him senseless when he realizes she is infected. Neville wakes in a prison where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not resent him. The infected have slowly overcome their disease until they can spend short periods of time in sunlight and are attempting to rebuild society. They fear and hate Neville who has destroyed some of their people along with the true vampires (dead bodies animated by the germ) during his daytime excursions against the latter. Neville goes to his prison window and sees all the infected waiting for his execution. He remarks to himself as he dies: ""[I am] entering the unassailable fortress of superstition forever. I am legend"", and then dies as a result of his injuries. ""To them, he was an killer who moved by day, even as they hibernated as they were pre-infection times, he is now a remnant of old humanity, now a legend, and the new race of the infection born of the pandemic"", he says. ""I am a legend"", he adds, ""and I am entering theUnassailable Fortress of superstitious superstition, forever, to be a legend. To them they view him as to be invisible, in awe of him, and even as he kills their loved ones, he kills them as if they were vampires in pre- Infection times"". ""I Am A Legend"" is out now on Blu-ray and DVD. It is implied that the pand epidemic was caused by a war, and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the mosquito population. The vampires only come out at night and become comatose by day,. though they also sometimes come out earlier during cloudy weather. Neville discovers that the root of the disease in a strain of bacteria capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts. Neville also discovers more efficient means of killing the infected, other than just driving a stake into their hearts. This included exposing them to direct sunlight (which killed the bacteria) or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies."
147,The Stranger,"Meursault is a French man who kills an Arab man and is sentenced to death. He expresses no remorse or personal emotions for any of his actions in life. In the end, Meursault grasps the universe's indifference towards humankind (coming to terms with his execution with his rage) The novel is written in two parts, one for each of the two parts of Meursaults' life. It is set in Paris, France, in the 1970s and 1980s. The author is the son of a French woman who died in a car crash. He was raised by his father, who died of a heart attack, and his brother, who was also killed by a car accident. He is now living with his brother's ex-wife, Marie, and has a sexual relationship with her. He also has a relationship with his neighbour, Raymond Sintès, who he helps to take revenge on a Moorish girlfriend suspected of infidelity. He kills the girlfriend's brother and an Arab friend with a pistol he took from Raymond so that Raymond would not do anything rash. He then shoots the corpse four more times after a brief pause. He does not divulge to the reader any specific reason for his crime or emotions he experiences at the time, if any, aside from the fact that he was bothered by the heat and bright sunlight. In prison, while awaiting the execution of his death sentence by the guillotine, he meets with a chaplain, but rejects his proffered opportunity of turning to God, explaining that God is a waste of his time. He finally explodes in a rage, with a climactic outburst at the absurdity of his personal anguish at the meaning of his existence without respite. At the end of the book, he says: ""As if that blind rage had washed me clean, for the first time, I opened myself to the benign indifference of the world. Finding myself in the night with stars and stars, that is so much so much more beautiful than the world."" The book is published by Macmillan, priced £16.99, and is available in English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The first edition of the novel was published in France in 1973, and was republished in the U.S. in 1974. The second edition was released in the United States in 1978, and the third in the UK in 1979, with the option of an English translation of the first edition being included in the second edition."
148,The Man in the High Castle,"The Man in the High Castle contains a loose collection of characters. Some of them know each other, while others are connected in more indirect ways. Three characters guide their lives based on the I Ching. One of the core narrative elements (Operation Dandelion) is centred on a pre-emptive Nazi nuclear strike on the Japanese Home Islands. The initial plot device is used to show the initial difference of opinions in the novel, with the differing opinions being those being a real antique and a real person. The Grasshopper Lies Heavy to the plot and Heavy Lies To the plot is a plot device to show. the initial opinion of the novel is that the opinions of the main characters, Frank Frink and Juliana Frink, are not real. The novel is set in a post-World War II world in which the Third Reich and Imperial Japan became the resultant superpowers of their world and consequently embarked upon a Cold War. The main character, Frank, works for the Wyndham–Matson Corporation, which specializes in reproductions of pre-war Americana artifacts; he is fired for showing his temper. He is a secret Jew (né Fink) who hides to avoid extermination in a Nazi camp. He believes in the essential inferiority of the non-white races of the Asian and African races, but is very conscious of his image, often deliberating how his actions might appear to others. Frank's ex-wife, Juliana, is a judo instructor, who evolves throughout the rest of the book to her becoming a very central plot piece. She is also used throughout the book by a hired assassin. The book is written in the style of Vichy France and is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99 (including p&p) and £12.99 for the Kindle edition (with p&P).

149,Rocket Ship Galileo,"After World War II, three teenage boy rocket experimenters are recruited by the uncle of one of them. They refit a conventionally-powered surplus ""mail rocket"" to run on a thorium nuclear pile which boils zinc as a propellant. Upon completion of the modifications, they stock the rocket, which they name the Galileo, and take off for the Moon, taking approximately 11 days to arrive. After establishing a semi-permanent structure based on a Quonset hut, they claim the moon on behalf of the United Nations. They discover that there is a Nazi base on the Moon. They bomb it from their captured ship and land. One survivor is found, revived, and questioned. The boys also find evidence of an ancient lunar civilization, and postulate that the craters of the moon were formed not by impacts from space, but by nuclear bombs that destroyed the alien race. When the base's Nazi leader shoots the pilot in order to silence him, Cargraves convenes a trial and find him guilty of murder. He capitulates in the airlock and teaches them how to fly the Nazi spaceship back to Earth.

150,Space Cadet,"Matt Dodson, Oscar Jensen, and William Jarman join the Space Patrol in 2075. Their first real mission is to help search for a missing research vessel, the Pathfinder, in the Asteroid Belt. They find it, but all aboard are dead, the unlucky victims of a fast-moving meteor that punctured the ship when the armored outer airlock door was open. Dodson is initially disappointed when they are not treated as heroes—but then he realizes that what they accomplished was simply what was expected of Patrolmen. They soon find out why. These particular natives had never seen human beings before, until old classmate Burke showed up in a prospecting ship. He had taken the matriarch of the local clan hostage when she refused to give him permission to exploit a rich deposit of radioactive ores. The locals promptly attacked the ship and killed his crew, but Burke managed to send a message for help before being taken prisoner. With the help of the natives, the cadets recommission the ship to fly it back to (human) civilization at Venus's South Pole colony. The crew of the Astarte, the legendary first ship to set out for Venus over a century before and thought to have been lost en route, perished from disease. According to the log, the crew perished from Disease. The captain of the Aes Triplex transfers half the crew to the repaired Pathfinder so that they can take the ship back to Earth quickly. The remainder (including all three cadets) continue their patrol. They are sent to investigate an incident on Venus's surface. The lander touches down on a sinkhole, barely giving the crew enough time to get out before it disappears in the mud. Neither the lander nor Burke's ship is flightworthy. To their amazement, she takes the stranded humans to the carefully preserved Astarte and takes them to the South Pole, where they are reunited with Dodson and the other cadets. The story ends with the crew returning to Earth and returning to their normal lives. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis and co-written by Mark O'Mara and David Walliams. The movie was released on September 25, 2075, and is available on Blu-ray and DVD. It is the first film in a series of three films. The second film is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2076. The third film will be released in 2077, and the fourth on October 2, 2078."

152,Starman Jones,"Max Jones works the family farm in the Ozark Mountains. With his father dead and his stepmother remarrying a man he detests, Max runs away from home, taking his uncle's astrogation manuals. Along the way, he finds a friendly face in hobo Sam Anderson, who later alludes to being a deserter from the Imperial Marines. Max signs on as a steward's mate third class, and then he absorbs the contents of the Stewards' Guild manual using his eidetic memory. The Asgard then departs for Halcyon, a human colony planet orbiting Nu Pegasi. When Max detects an error in his real-time calculations leading up to a ""transition"", neither the captain nor Assistant Astrogator Simes believe him and the ship winds up lost. They locate a habitable world, and the passengers become colonists. Vastly outnumbered by the hostile natives, the humans are forced to attempt a perilous return to known space by reversing the erroneous transition. However, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by intelligent centaurs. Max and Ellie are captured, but Ellie's pet is able to guide Sam and a rescue party to them. They escape, though Sam is killed covering their retreat. Upon his return, Max is informed that the captain has died, leaving Max as the only remaining astrogator.

In the end, Max accepts his role as captain and is promoted to the command deck. He also loses his relationship with Ellie, who returns home and marries her boyfriend, but she diplomatically lets him win a game of three-dimensional chess against her pet, an alien, semi-intelligent ""spider puppy"" that Max has befriended, and she challenges him to a game."
153,Podkayne of Mars,"The book is a first-person narrative in the form of Podkayne's diaries. Much of the description of the voyage is based on Heinlein's own experiences as a naval officer and world traveler. Heinlein anticipated, by over forty years, television ads in taxicabs (in the book, holographic), which have since been implemented in major cities worldwide. The story ends with a hint of hope for him, as he admits his responsibility for what happened to PodKayne &mdash; that he ""mdash &fubbed it, mighty drymdash"" & then describes his inability to cry and raise the fairy. In the original ending, Pod Kayne is killed. This did not please his publisher, who demanded and got a rewrite over the author's bitter objections. He also declared that the end ""isn't real life, because in real life,. not everything happily ends."" In the end they escape from the kidnappers to a safe distance that has been left behind, and he returns to rescue it. When the nuclear bomb that Clark leaves for the kidnapper blows up, PodkayNE is killed, shielding the young fairy with her body. In a letter to Lurton Blassingame, his literary agent, Heinlein complained that it would be like ""revising Romeo and Juliet to let the young lovers live happily ever after."" He changed the ending to one that would allow them to live happily after the end of the book. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book. It is published in the U.S. for the first time on September 11, 2013. The first edition was published on September 10, 1983. It has a run time of 1,000 pages.

Meanwhile, representatives of an advanced, powerful and previously unknown alien race appear and demand the return of their lost child...or else. A friendly alien diplomat of a third species intimates that the threat is not an empty one. This gives the chief human negotiator the leverage he needs to avert the destruction of Earth.

His task is to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6 Station J in Kingston, Jamaica, and his secretary. On his arrival in Jamaica, Bond soon realises that he is being watched, as his hotel room is searched, a basket of poisoned fruit is delivered to his room and a deadly centipede is placed in his bed while he is sleeping. With the help of old friend Quarrel, Bond visits Crab Key to establish if there is a connection between Strangway's disappearance and the activities of Dr. Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who runs a guano mine. Bond discovers that Dr. No is also working with the Russians and has built an elaborate underground facility from which he can sabotage American missile tests at nearby Cape Canaveral. He is kept under regular observation, suffering electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders along the way.

159,Down and Out in Paris and London,"From Chapter III to Chapter X, where the narrator obtains a job at ""Hotel X,"" he describes his descent into poverty. He recounts his two-day experience without any food and tells of meeting Russian ""Communists"" who, he later concludes, on their disappearance, must be mere swindlers. In Chapter XXII, the narrator considers the life of a plongeur [a youth who had run away from home] He has been trapped by a routine which makes it impossible to have a holiday. He is no freer than if he were bought and sold, but still, he is better off than many manual workers, but he is still servile and servile, he says. The narrative is interspersed with anecdotes recounted by some of the minor characters, such as Valenti, an Italian waiter at an local restaurant. The narrator is not paid for ten days and is compelled to spend a night on a bench rather than face his landlady over the outstanding rent. He falls into a routine again and speaks of quite literally fighting for a place on the Paris Métro in order to reach the &#34;cold, filthy kitchen&#34.; by seven. He has thought that all plongeurs would have thought that they would long ago be free, but that is not the case, he writes. He says he is no longer free, and his only thought is that he is only paid enough to keep him alive; his only holiday is the sack [a holiday is only a holiday]. He is not free, for he has thought he would have been free long ago, but they would not have thought they would be free. He writes: ""I am no longer freer, for I am not free. I am trapped by the routine of a routine, which makes a holiday impossible, and I have been trapped for a holiday... I am no free, at all. I have not been free for a long, long time, but I am trying to be free."" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, and is available in hardcover, paperback, and e-book.

160,The Last Man,"Lionel is the first-person narrative of a man living at the end of the 21st century. Mary Shelley states in the introduction that in 1818 she discovered a collection of prophetic writings painted on leaves by the Cumaean Sibyl. She has edited these writings into the current narrative.

161,The Transmigration of Timothy Archer,"The novel is set in the late 1960s and 1970s. It is one of Dick's most overtly philosophical and intellectual works. The story is told in the first person by a single narrator: Angel Archer, Bishop Archer's daughter-in-law. The character of Bishop Archer is loosely based on the controversial, iconoclastic Episcopal Bishop James Pike, who in 1969 died of exposure while exploring the Judean Desert near the Dead Sea in the West Bank. Tim is already being investigated for his allegedly heretical views about the Zadokite scrolls, which reproduce some of Jesus Christ's statements about the world, but have been dated to the second century before the birth of Christ. Tim travels to Israel to investigate whether or not a psychotropic mushroom was associated with the resurrection, but his car stalls, he becomes disoriented, falls from a cliff, and dies in the desert. Angel agrees to care for Bill, in return for a rare record that Edgar Barefoot, a guru, offers her. On the houseboat, Angel is reunited with Bill, Kirsten's son who has schizophrenia. He claims to have Tim's reincarnated spirit within him, but is soon reinsitutionalised. Angel is sceptical about the efficacy of astrology, and believes that the unfolding existential situation of Tim and Kirsten is akin to Friedrich Schiller's German Romanticism era masterpiece, the Wallenstein trilogy (insofar as their credulity reflects the loss of rational belief in contemporary consensual reality). The three are told that Kirsten and Tim will die, as predicted, and also commits suicide after a barbiturate overdose. Angel may represent Dick's effort to prove he could create a rich and believable feminine voice. Dick's work was often criticized for its flat, stereotypical female characters, so Angel could represent his effort to create a richer, more believable female voice. The novel was published in paperback on November 25, 1980. It has been described as one of the best-selling novels of all time. It was published by Simon & Schuster, with a run-down edition of 2,000 copies. The book is available in hardback and hardback, priced between £16.99 and £24.99.

162,Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency,"Four billion years in Earth's past, a group of Salaxalans attempts to populate the earth. A mistake caused by their engineer causes their landing craft to explode. The ghost of the Salaxalan engineer roams the earth waiting to undo his mistake, watching human life develop and waiting to find a soul that it can possess. In the early 19th century, the ghost discovers Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and influences the writer to add a second section to ""Kubla Khan"" and alter parts of ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"" The ghost then begins seeking out someone whose hardship can be influenced by Colersidge's work. It later discovers that Professor Urban ""Reg"" Chronotis at St Cedd's possesses a time machine disguised as his quarters. In late 20th century the ghost influences Reg to use the time machine to perform a bit of trickery for a young child at the dinner, while the ghost lures another Electric Monk into Reg's quarters. The Monk then goes off to kill Wayforward Technologies II's CEO, Gordon Way, due to a misunderstanding. Theghost later tries to influence Richard MacDuff, a former student of Reg and current employee of Gordon Way. Richard discusses this with his former college friend Dirk Gently, who claims to be a ""Holistic Detective"" believing in the ""fundamental interconnectedness of all things"" They travel back, and ghost-possessed Michael, using a makeshift environmental suit, sets up to repair the damage to the landing craft. While they watch, Richard receives a call from Susan from the 20th Century on Reg's phone. Richard learns of Ross's murder, and Dirk quickly surmises the ghost's plan, which if successful will erase the formation of life on Earth. Realising Michael was influenced byColeridge's works, Dirk instructs Reg to take them to the 19th Century, allowing Dirk to interrupt the ghost and prevent the second part of ""Kubsh Khan"" from ever having been written. Upon arrival back in the 20ths century, Dirk, Richard, and Reg find humanity as they expect it but with very small, subtle changes. The first client was missing in the first place as a result of the first functions of their actions – adding a small amount for the finding of the lost cat, adding ""saving the entire human race from extinction – no charge for the loss of the cat"" – and the first client is added to the list of clients."
163,Dragonflight,"Dragonflight chronicles the story of Lessa, the sole survivor of the noble ruling family of Ruatha Hold on the northern continent of Pern. When the rest of her family is killed by a cruel usurper, Fax, she survives by disguising herself as a drudge. She uses her hereditary telepathic abilities to make others see her as far older and less attractive than she actually is. Lessa travels four hundred turns into the past to bring the five'missing' Weyrs forward to her present. She convinces the dragonriders of the five Weyrs to go with her to their future, and they use the Red Star as a guide to make smaller, less strenuous hops forward in time.

164,The Diamond Age,"The protagonist in the story is Nell, a thete (or person without a tribe) living in the Leased Territories, a lowland slum belt on the artificial, diamondoid island of New Chusan. At the age of four, Nell receives a stolen copy of an interactive book, Young Lady's Illustrated Primer: a Propædeutic Enchiridion in which is told the tale of Princess Nell and her various friends, kin, associates. The story follows Nell's development under the tutelage of the Primer, and to a lesser degree, the lives of Elizabeth and Fiona, girls who receive similar books. ""Diamond Age"" is an extension of labels for archeological time periods that take central technological materials to define an entire era of human history, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age or the Iron Age. In the novel, a near future vision of our world, nanotechnology has developed precisely to this point, which enables the cheap production of diamond structures. If nanotechnology develops the ability to manipulate individual atoms at will, it will become possible to simply assemble diamond structures from carbon atoms, materials also known as diamondoids. The title can also be seen as a reference to the Gilded Age, a time of economic expansion roughly coinciding with the late Victorian era, and Queen Victoria's reign, the apex of which is often seen as her Diamond Jubilee. The most important quality to achieving an ""interesting life"" is deemed to be a subversive attitude towards the status quo. The Primer is intended to intellectually steer its reader toward a more interesting life, as defined by ""Equity Lord"" Alexander Chung-Sik Finkle-McGraw, and grow up to be an effective member of society. The text also includes fully narrated educational tales from the Primers database. Although The Diamond Age explores the role of technology and personal relationships in child development, its deeper and darker themes also probe the relative values of cultures (which Stephenson explores in his other novels as well) and the shortcomings in communication between them. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback, paperback and e-book. It is priced at £16.99 ($24.99) with a recommended reading age of 8.5 (including free shipping and p&p).

Qu asmodo then goes to the vaults under the huge gibbet of Montfaucon, where it had been unceremoniously thrown after the execution, and eventually dies of starvation. About eighteen months later, the tomb is opened, and the skeletons are found. As someone tries to separate them, Qu asmsimodo's bones turn to dust, and his bones are found to have been turned to dust by the skeleton of his love, who had been killed by the king's men.

They decide to explore the attic connecting the houses, but take the wrong door and surprise Digory's Uncle Andrew in his study. Uncle Andrew tricks Polly into touching a yellow magic ring, causing her to vanish. Then he explains to Digory that he has been dabbling in magic, and that the rings allow travel between one world and another.

172,Time for the Stars,"Long Range Foundation has built a dozen exploratory starships to search for habitable planets to colonize. Each starship has a much larger than necessary crew to maintain a more stable, long-term shipboard society. Some of the spacefaring twins, including the protagonist, are able to connect with the descendants of the Earthbound twins. The explorers return to an Earth they no longer recognize, and in most cases, no longer fit in. Tom, however, returns to marry his last telepathic partner, his own great-grandniece, who has been reading his mind since childhood. The ship visits several star systems. The last planet (Elysa) scouted proves to be particularly deadly. Unexpectedly intelligent and hostile natives capture and kill a large portion of the remaining crew. The reserve captain takes charge, but is unable to restore the morale of the devastated survivors. When he insists on continuing the mission rather than returning to Earth, the crew begins to consider mutiny. Shortly after he notifies Earth of the dire situation, they are surprised to hear a spaceship will rendezvous with them in less than a month and surmise it must be a more advanced LRF spaceship. Scientists on Earth have discovered faster-than-light travel, in part due to research into the nature of telepathy, and are collecting the remaining crews of the LRF torchships. Tom works with his niece, then his grandniece and finally his great-Grandniece. He returns to Earth with his wife, his daughter, and his son-in-law, who have been married for more than 30 years and have a son and a daughter- in-law who have also been married. The novel is about a group of teenagers who discover that some twins and triplets can communicate with each other telepathically. The process seems to be instantaneous and unweakened by distance, making it the only practical means of communication for ships traveling many light years away from Earth. However, the twin who remained behind ages faster and eventually the affinity between them is weakened to the point that they are no longer able to communicate easily. The book ends with Tom and Pat Bartlett on a mission to find the last habitable planet on which they have been scouted, the planet of Elysa. It is the first of a series of books about the Long Range Foundation. The second book is about the foundation's attempts to find habitable planets on the other side of the solar system."

178,The Cat Who Walks Through Walls,"Colonel Colin Campbell, living under a number of aliases including his pen name ""Richard Ames"" is joined by a beautiful and sophisticated lady, Gwendolyn Novak, who helps him flee to Luna with a bonsai maple and a would-be murderer. After escaping to the moon, Gwen refers to the now ancient Lunar Revolt and Mike (Mycroft), the self-aware computer responsible for the uprising's victory. Despite her claim that she was only a girl at the time, Campbell grows suspicious, and learns that she is a rejuvenation of the revolution's most prominent female leader. Still pursued by assassins, Campbell and Novak are rescued by an organization known as the Time Corps under the leadership of Lazarus Long. The Time Corps attempt to recruit Campbell for a special mission. Accepting only on Gwen's account, Campbell agrees to assist a team to retrieve the decommissioned Mike. The story ends with Campbell talking into a recorder (presumably the source of the first-person medium through which the story is told) reflecting on the mission and his relationship with Gwen. During the mission,. Gwen is grievously wounded and Campbell loses his foot again, though the time-travelers succeed in retrieving Mike. Campbell's frequent would- be assassins are revealed to be members of contemporary agencies also engaged in time manipulation who, for unknown reasons, do not want to see Mike rescued by the. Time Corps. Engaged in frequent time- travel, the Time. Corps has been responsible for changing various events in the past, creating an alternate universe with every time-line they disrupt. Mike's assistance is needed in order to accurately predict the conditions and following events in each of the new universes created. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is described in the book as being about Campbell's relationship with his girlfriend Gwen, as well as the events that led up to her death.

179,Methuselah's Children,"The Howard Families derive from Ira Howard, who became rich in the California Gold Rush, but died young and childless. Fearing death, he left his money for the prolongation of human life, and the trustees of his will carried out his wishes by financially encouraging those with long-lived grandparents to marry and have children. While the Families have kept their existence secret, with the enlightened human society established under The Covenant, they decide to reveal themselves. Society refuses to believe the Howard Families simply 'chose their ancestors wisely', instead insisting they have developed a method to extend life. The Families are persecuted and interned. In the process of escaping, they are driven too near the Sun by military spacecraft. When they are a few minutes away from overheating, Heinlein invokes a deus ex machina: it turns out that one member of the Families, Andrew Jackson Libby, has managed to invent a device that removes inertia from any mass to which it is attached. Libby applies the device, and instantaneously, New Frontiers is accelerated by light-pressure from the Sun to nearly the speed of light. The families return to the Solar System seventy-five years after their original departure. To their surprise they find that on Earth great longevity is commonplace. Spurred on by the belief that there was a specific ""technique"" to the Howards' longevity, Earth's scientists developed a series of treatments that extended lifespans to several centuries. They are now free to return, and are even welcomed due to their discovery of faster than light travel. Thanks to humanity's increased lifespan, the Solar system is overcrowded; faster thanlight travel will allow emigrants to ease the population explosion. The first planet they discover has humanoid inhabitants who seem friendly and advanced - but they are merely domesticated animals belonging to the planet's true masters. The second planet is a lush environment with no predators and mild weather. Its inhabitants are part of a group mind with the mental ability to manipulate the environment on the genetic and molecular level. They have no independent personalities; anyone who joins the group mind ceases to exist as a unique individual. This becomes evident when Mary Sperling, second oldest of the families, who has always been fearful of death, joins theGroup mind in an attempt to become truly immortal. The Group mind, in a mistaken effort to be helpful, genetically modifies the first baby born on the planet into a new, alien form. He states that humans are what they are because they are individuals, and that they have no place on this world."
180,Life: A User's Manual,"A wealthy Englishman, Bartlebooth, devises a plan that will both occupy the remainder of his life and spend his entire fortune. He spends 10 years learning to paint watercolors under the tutelage of Valène, who also becomes a resident of 11 Rue Simon-Crubellier. Then, he embarks on a 20-year trip around the world with his loyal servant Smautf, painting a watercolor of a different port roughly every two weeks for a total of 500 paintings. Each painting is then sent back to France, where the paper is glued to a support board, and a carefully selected craftsman cuts it into a jigsaw puzzle. Upon his return, Bartlbooth spends his time solving each jigsaw, re-creating the scene. Ultimately, there would be nothing to show for 50 years of work: the project would leave absolutely no mark on the world. By 1975, Bart Lebooth is 16 months behind in his plans, and he dies while he is about to finish his 439th puzzle. Ironically, the last hole in the puzzle is in the shape of the letter X while the piece that he is holding is in a shape of a letter W. The painting is placed in a detergent solution until the colors dissolve, and the paper, blank except for the faint marks where it was cut and re-joined, is returned to Bartle booth. It is the last piece of art that he has left to show the world: the painting is put in a furnace locally instead of couriered back to the sea, for fear of those involved in the task betraying him. Bartle Booth is forced to change his plans and have the watercolor burned in the furnace locally rather than couriering it back to sea. He dies in 1975, and his last piece is the painting of the port where he was painted, exactly 20 years to the day after it was painted. He is buried in the same port as the painting he painted 20 years earlier, in the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, in front of a group of people who are also residents of 11 rue Simon- Crubelier. The final piece is a picture of the city of St. Germain, which was painted by a man named Georges Morellet, who is also a member of the same street. The picture is shown at the end of the film."
181,The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,"Dorothy is a young orphaned girl raised by her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em in the bleak landscape of a Kansas farm. She has a little black dog Toto, who is her sole source of happiness on the dry, gray prairies. One day the farmhouse, with Dorothy and Toto inside, is caught up in a cyclone and deposited in a field in Munchkin Country, the eastern quadrant of the Land of Oz. The falling house kills the evil ruler of the Munchkins, the Wicked Witch of the East. In order to return to Kansas, Dorothy will have to go to the ""Emerald City"" or ""City of Emeralds"" and ask the Wizard of Oz to help her. All four of the travelers believe that the Wizard can solve their troubles. The four are the first to ever successfully meet with the Wizard. The Wizard provides the Scarecrow with a head full of pins, the Cowardly Lion with a silk heart stuffed with sawdust, and the Tin Woodman with a lot of bran-new brains. Because of their faith in the Wizard, Dorothy and her friends meet the Wizard again, and he reveals himself to be an ordinary old man who had journeyed to Oz from Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon. The trip ends when Dorothy learns how to use the Golden Cap and summons the Winged Monkeys to carry her and her companions back to the Emerald City. When Dorothy and the Monkeys meet the sorceress Gayelette by the Wizard and the King of Oz again, he tries to put them off by putting them off in a corner of the throne room, but he accidentally tips over a screen and reveals the Wizard to be a man who has been longing to return home and be in a circus again since a circus circus again. The party finds many adventures on their journey together, including overcoming obstacles such as narrow pieces of the yellow brick road, vicious Kalidahs, a river and the Deadly Poppies. When the travelers arrive at the Emerald city, they are asked to wear green spectacles by the Guardian of the Gates as long as they remain in the city. When each traveler meets with theizard, he appears each time as someone or something different. To Dorothy, the Wizard is a giant head; the Scarerow sees a beautiful woman; the Tin woodman sees a ravenous beast; the Cowardsly Lion sees a ball of fire. The Wicked Witch. of the West rules over the western Winkie Country. The Winkies rejoice at being freed of the witch's tyranny, and they help to reassemble the scarecrow and the tin Woodman."

183,Wuthering Heights,"In 1801, Mr. Lockwood rents Thrushcross Grange in the north of England for peace and recuperation. He finds the inhabitants of Wuthering Heights to be a rather strange group: Mr. Heathcliff appears a gentleman but his mannerisms suggest otherwise; the reserved mistress of the house is in her mid-teens; and a young man appears to be one of the family, although he dresses and talks like a servant. Thirty years prior, the Earnshaw family lived on the moors. The children of the. family are the teenaged Hindley and his younger sister, Catherine. Hindley finds himself robbed of his. father's affections and becomes bitterly jealous of Heath.cliff. Catherine eventually returns to the Grange as a changed woman, looking and acting as a lady. She falls in love with HeathCliff, seeing him as a romantic hero. He encourages the infatuation, seeing it as a chance for revenge on Edgar, Hindley's gambling habits and Hareton's bad habits. After three years, the pair are married. Six months later, Edgar and Catherine run away, without a trace, and Catherine and Heathcl Cliff return to the farmhouse to live as a couple. They have a son, Hareton, but she dies before the year is out. This leads Hindley to descend into a life of drunkenness and waste. He eventually marries a woman named Frances and returns three years later, after Mr. Earnshaw dies. He becomes master of Wuthring Heights, and forces Heathcliffs to become a servant instead of a member of theFamily. He and Catherine have an argument with Nelly, which then spreads to Edgar who tries to leave. One day in August, while Hindley is absent, Edgar comes to visit Catherine and, before long, they declare themselves lovers. She says that she does not really love Edgar but HeathclIFF. She therefore plans to marry Edgar and use that position to help raise Heathcl Clifford's standing. When Hindley returns, he embraces her and embraces Isabella, who is not so keen on Edgar. He then runs away, leaving Catherine and Edgar behind. He returns six months later as a gentleman, having grown stronger and richer during his absence. Catherine is delighted to see him and is not keen to see Edgar, although Edgar is. She later explains that she had asked her to marry him and she had accepted. He swears vengeance on Hindley. When the Lintons visit the next day, he dresses up to impress her."
184,Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre is an orphan living with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds. Her aunt Sarah Reed does not like her and treats her worse than a servant. She is finally rescued when she is allowed to attend Lowood School for Girls. After six years as a student and two as a teacher, Jane decides to leave Lowood, like her friend and confidante Miss Temple. She advertises her services as a governess, and receives one reply. She takes the position, teaching Adele Varens, a young French girl. While Jane is walking one night to a nearby town, a horseman passes her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. She helps him to the horse. Later, back at the mansion she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. He teases her, asking whether she bewitched his horse to make him fall.

185,Catch-22,"The development of the novel can be split into segments. The first (chapters 1–11) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1943. While the first five parts ""sections"" develop the novel in the present and through use of flash-backs, the novel significantly darkens in chapters 32–41. The horror begins with the attack on the undefended Italian mountain village, with the following chapters involving despair, disappearance in combat (Orr and Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) or death (Nately, McWatt, Mudd, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe) of most of Yossarian's friends. In Chapter 41, the full details of the gruesome death of Snowden are finally revealed, but the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarians learning of Orr's miraculous escape to Sweden and Yossary's pledge to follow him there. In the sixth and final part ( chapter 32 on) while remaining in the ""present"" time the novel takes a much darker turn and spends the remaining chapters focusing on the serious and brutal nature of war and life in general. The final chapter focuses on the rape and murder of Michaela, who represents pure innocence, in which the reader is shown the full effect of the horror of the events that have taken place in the first four and a half thirds of the book. Despite this, the book ends on a positive note with the reader being able to follow Orr to Sweden, where he has made a miraculous escape from the Gestapo and is now living a normal life. The novel is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book versions for £16.99 (with a suggested reading price of £12.99).

186,Robinson Crusoe,"Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name ""Kreutznaer"") sets sail from the Queen's Dock in Hull on a sea voyage in August 1651, against his parents' wishes. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his lust for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster as the ship is taken over by Salé pirates (the Salé Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a Captain of a Portuguese ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. Years later, Crusoe joins an expedition to bring slaves from Africa but he is shipwrecked on an island (which he calls the Island of Despair) near the mouth of the Orinoco river on September 30, 1659. Only he and three animals, the captain's dog and two cats, survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms, tools, and other supplies from the ship before it breaks apart and sinks. He builds a fenced-in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a calendar. He hunts, grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery, and raises goats. He also adopts a small parrot. He reads the Bible and becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society. He leaves the island 19 December 1686 and arrives in England on 11 June 1687. He learns that his family believed him dead; as a result, he was left nothing in his father's will. Crusoe departs for Lisbon to reclaim the profits of his estate in Brazil, which has granted him much wealth. In conclusion, he transports his wealth overland to England to avoid travelling by sea. On the way, he and Friday endure one last adventure together as they fight off famished wolves while crossing the Pyrenees. They endure one final adventure together, and, en route, they face off against famished Wolves.

187,King Lear,"King Lear decides to divide his realm among his three daughters. He offers the largest share to the one who loves him best. Goneril and Regan both proclaim in fulsome terms that they love him more than anything in the world. For Cordelia, there is nothing to compare her love to, nor words to properly express it; she speaks honestly but bluntly, which infuriates him. In his anger he disinherits her, and divides the kingdom between Regan and Gomeril. Lear is further enraged by Kent's protests, and banishes him from the country. Lear summons the Duke of Burgundy and the King of France, who have both proposed marriage to Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. The two sisters take charge of Lear, whose madness slowly passes. He is now completely mad and rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off to kill himself and his daughters. Kent leads Lear to the French army, which is accompanied by Cordelia and the two sisters. He insists that they fight the French invaders but not harm the French or Lear. He promises both sisters that he will not harm Cordelia or Lear or Albany. The sisters promise him that they will kill Albany and Cordelia if he does not kill them. Lear dies in a storm, accompanied by the mocking Fool. The Fool mocks Lear's misfortune, and Lear yields completely to his rage. He rushes out into a storm to rant against his ungrateful daughters, and Kent later follows to protect him. Lear meets Edgar, in the guise of a madman named Tom o' Bedlam, and babbles madly while Lear denounces his daughters, while Kent leads them all to shelter. Lear announces he will live alternately with Regan, and their husbands, the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall respectively. He reserves to himself a retinue of one hundred knights, to be supported by his sisters. Lear discovers that now that Gonerill has power, she no longer respects him, and she orders him to behave better and reduces his retinues. Lear then meets Oswald at Gloucester's home, quarrels with him and is put in the stocks by regan and her husband Cornwall. When Lear arrives, he objects, but Regan takes the same line and echoes Regan. Regan kills the servant, and tells Gloucester that Edmund betrayed him; then she turns him out to wander the heath too. Gloucester is completely taken in."

190,Julius Caesar,"Marcus Brutus is Caesar's close friend and a Roman praetor. Brutus allows himself to be cajoled into joining a group of conspiring senators because of a growing suspicion that Caesar intends to turn republican Rome into a monarchy under his own rule. The early scenes deal mainly with Brutus's arguments with Cassius and his struggle with his own conscience. Caesar's assassination is one of the most famous scenes of the play, occurring in Act 3 (the other is Mark Antony's oration ""Friends, Romans, countrymen"".) After Caesar's death, Brutus delivers an oration defending his actions, and for the moment, the crowd is on his side. The play ends with a tribute to Brutus by Antony, who proclaims that Brutus has remained ""the noblest Roman of them all"" because he was the only conspirator who acted for the good of Rome. There is then a small hint at the friction between Antony and Octavius which will characterise another of Shakespeare's Roman plays, Antony & Cleopatra, in Act 4. The beginning of Act Four is marked by the quarrel scene, where Brutus attacks Cassius for soiling the noble act of regicide by accepting bribes. During the battle, Cassius commits suicide after hearing of the capture of his best friend, Titinius. After Tit inius, who wasn't really captured, sees Cassius's corpse, he commits suicide. The two are reconciled; they prepare for war with Mark AntONY and Caesar's adopted son, Octavian (Shakespeare's spelling:Octavius). That night, Cassian and Brutus knowing they will probably both die, smile their last smiles to each other and hold hands. With a heavy heart, Brutu battles again the next day. He loses and commits suicide, but his victory is not conclusive. Shakespeare has him add, ""Then fall, Caesar,"" suggesting that Caesar did not want to survive such treachery. The conspirators make clear that they committed this act for Rome, not for their own purposes and do not attempt to flee the scene. The innocent poet, Cinna, is confused with the conspirator Lucius CInna and is murdered by the mob. In Act 4, the innocent poet is mistaken for the conspirators and is killed by the mobs. In the end, the mob rouses the mob to drive the conspirates from Rome. The plot is revealed to have been a ruse."
191,Emma,"Emma Woodhouse, aged 20 at the start of the novel, is a young, beautiful, witty, and privileged woman in Regency England. She lives on the fictional estate of Hartfield in Surrey in the village of Highbury with her elderly widowed father, a hypochondriac who is excessively concerned for the health and safety of his loved ones. As the novel opens, Emma has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her best friend and former governess. Having introduced Miss Taylor to her future husband, Mr. Weston, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she rather likes matchmaking. Emma tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith, a sweet, pretty, but none-too-bright parlour boarder of seventeen, to Mr. Elton, the local vicar. Emma's schemes go awry when Mr Elton fancies Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. After Emma rejects him, he leaves for a while for a sojourn in Bath, and Harriet fancies herself heartbroken. Emma feels dreadful about misleading Harriet and resolves—briefly—to interfere less in people's lives. An interesting development is the arrival in the neighbourhood of the handsome and charming Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son, who had been given to his deceased wife's wealthy brother and his wife, the Churchills, to raise. The whole neighborhood takes a fancy to him, with the partial exception of Mr. Knightley, who becomes uncharacteristically grumpy whenever his name is mentioned and suggests to Emma that while Frank is clever and engaging, he is also a rather shallow character. Emma begins to feel some sympathy for Jane Fairfax, the orphaned niece of Emma's impoverished neighbour, the talkative Miss Bates, who lives with her deaf, widowed mother. Jane, very gifted musically, is Miss Bates' pride and joy; Emma envies her talent, and although she has known Jane all her life, has never warmed to her personally. Emma imagines Jane's sudden return to Highbury and imagines that she will find her ideal governess under her wing. But Miss Campbell has married, and Jane has returned to her relations, ostensibly to regain her health and earn her penniless. Emma is annoyed to find the entire neighborhood in Highbury's sudden and mysterious return to Miss Campbell's house, including Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley. Mrs Weston, singing Jane's praises, but when Mrs. Weston's singing praises, sings Jane's own praises."

193,Anne of Green Gables,"Anne Shirley is a book about a young orphan from fictional community of Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia. She is sent to Prince Edward Island after a childhood spent in strangers' homes and orphanages. Anne is described as bright and quick, eager to please, talkative, and extremely imaginative. At 16, Anne goes to Queen's Academy to earn a teaching license, along with Gilbert, Ruby, Josie, Jane and several other students. She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two, and wins the Avery Scholarship for the top student in English. She plans to pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree at the fictional Redmond College (based on the real Dalhousie University) on the mainland in Nova Scotia, and return to Green Gables on weekends. In an act of friendship, Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School to work at White Sands School instead. After this kind act, Anne and Gilbert's friendship is cemented, and Anne looks forward to the next ""bend in the road."" Near the end of the book, Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla's money has been lost in a bank failure. Anne realizes she feels sorry about the events and no longer hates Gilbert, but cannot bring herself to admit it; by the end, they finally become friends. The book also follows Anne's adventures in quiet, old-fashioned AvonLEa. Episodes include her play time with friends (Diana, Jane Andrews and Ruby Gillis), her run-ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters (Gertie and Josie), and domestic mishaps such as dyeing her hair green (while intending to dye it black), or accidentally getting Diana drunk (by giving her what she thinks is raspberry cordial but is currant wine).

Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gable, Anne plans to teach at the Carmody school, the nearest school available, and returning to GreenGables on weekend. Anne says that they are 'kindred spirits' and that Matthew falls for her immediately. Anne and Matthew are best friends, and Matthew is the love of Anne's life. They live at Green Gabled, their AvonLea farmhouse on PrinceEdward Island. They also have a daughter, Lucy, and a son, Matthew."
194,The Wasp Factory,"The Wasp Factory is a huge clock face encased in a glass box and salvaged from the local dump. Behind each of the 12 numerals is a trap which leads to a different ritual death (for example burning, crushing, or drowning in Frank's urine) for the wasp that Frank puts into the hole at the center within tubes. There are also Sacrifice Poles, upon which hang the bodies and heads of larger animals, such as seagulls, that Frank has killed. They define and 'protect' the borders of Frank's territory - the island upon which he lives with his father. Frank is haunted by an accident which resulted in the loss of his genitalia, and resents others for his impotence, particularly women. Frank's older brother Eric is in an insane asylum after being arrested for brutalizing the town's dogs. He escapes at the start of the novel and throughout the book rings Frank from phone boxes to inform Frank of his progress back to the island. Their conversations invariably end badly, with Eric exploding in fits of rage. After confronting his father, Frank finds out that he is in fact female, and that when he thought he was castrated by a dog mauling at an early age, Frank's father had simply pumped her full of male hormones to see if she would transition from female to male. The father said it was simply ""an experiment"" and there are hints it was in order to distance himself from the women he felt had ruined his life. Frank remembers his older brother as being extremely sensitive before ""the incident"" that drove him mad: a tragic case of neglect in a hospital where Eric was a volunteer. He checks the usually-alert patient's head dressings to find the child's exposed brain tissue infested with day-old maggots. He is confused as to whether or not he is looking forward to seeing Eric, but it is clear Frank loves his brother dearly. Other than that, Frank has almost no contact with the outside world and admits he is afraid of it due to what it did to his brother, Eric. At the end of the book, Eric's imminent return precipitates a series of events that result in Frank discovering male hormone drugs in his father's study. The book ends with Frank discovering that his father had pumped his daughter with male hormones in an attempt to 'distance himself from women' and that he had been trying to 'turn her into a man' The book is published by Simon & Schuster."
195,Espedair Street,"Weir starts out in the Ferguslie Park area of Paisley in a very underprivileged Catholic family. He is impressed by a group named Frozen Gold when he sees them live, and auditions with them. Christine Brice likes his songs, and he joins the band. He ends up writing all their material and playing bass guitar, (after trying unsuccessfully to get them to change their name) as the band rises in the drug- and booze-fuelled rock and roll of the 1970s. He has grown uncomfortable with fame and wealth, and eventually visits his first girlfriend, Jean Webb, now living in Arisaig. In the Three Chimneys tour, singer Davey Balfour takes Dan along on an attempt to break an unofficial (and illegal) speed record for flying around three power station chimneys in Kent in his private plane. He reminisces about this from 1980s Glasgow, where he lives as a recluse in a Victorian folly (St Jutes), ever since the tragic events which led to the demise of the group. After a memorable fight in a nightclub called &#39;Monty&#38;s&#39%;, his real identity is revealed as Jimmy Hay. He then visits his former girlfriend Jean Webb and finds out that she is now living with her new partner in Scotland. He also visits his ex-wife Jean Webb in Scotland, and learns that she has remarried and has a son. The final chapter of the book is about Weir's decision to stay alive and to try and explain what he has gone through in the last two days. He says: ""Two days ago I decided to kill myself. Last night I changed my mind and decided to stay Alive"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster. For more information, visit www.simonandschuster.co.uk and www.samaritans.org.

196,The Crow Road,"This Bildungsroman is set in the fictional Argyll town of Gallanach and the real village of Lochgair. Prentice McHoan's uncle Rory has disappeared eight years previous while writing a book called The Crow Road. He becomes obsessed with papers his uncle left behind and sets out to solve the mystery. Along the way he must cope with estrangement from his father, unrequited love, sibling rivalry, and failure at his studies. The narrative is also fragmentary, leaping days, months, years, or decades back and forth with little or no warning, so the reader must also piece things together. A parallel plot is Prentice's gradual transition from an adolescent fixation on one young woman to a more mature love for another. It is also the story of his attempts to make sense of the world, love, and life in general. The book is published by Chatto & Windus, priced £16.99.

The Mind, while fleeing attacking Idirans who consider its existence an abomination, has taken refuge on Schar's World, a Planet of the Dead. The plot takes many digressions on the way to the denouement. The book opens with Horza about to die an extremely unpleasant death after killing and impersonating a member of the gerontocracy on a world not yet part of the Culture. He is rescued by theIdirans and given his mission to find the Culture Mind, but is soon captured by a Culture ship.

198,Inversions,"The book takes place on a fictional planet based on late-Middle Ages Europe. It alternates chapter-by- chapter between two concurrent storylines. The first storyline is presented as a written account from Oelph, publicly a doctor's assistant, but privately a spy for an individual identified only as ""Master"" The second storyline follows Vosill, the personal doctor to King Quience of Haspidus and a woman. The latter is unheard of in the patriarchal kingdom, and is tolerated only because Vosil claims citizenship in the far-off country of Drezen. The King himself is appreciative of her and her talents, but nonetheless her elevated position in defiance of the kingdom's social mores inspires hostility among others of the court. The book ends with the King dying, and the King inadvertently revealing the conspiracy against her to the King's Dukes and Guard Commander, Adlain, when the news of Ralinge's death reaches the Duke's chamber. The two are taken from the torturer's chamber shortly thereafter, as the King has taken ill and appears to be dying, though she indicates to him that this is what he ""should"" remember ""should he remember"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardcover and e-book versions for $24.99 (with a PDF version for $16.99, with a print-out of the book for $19.99).

199,An Inspector Calls,"Inspector Goole reveals that a woman called Eva Smith killed herself by drinking strong disinfectant. He implies that she has left a diary naming names, including members of the Birling family. The true identity of the woman is never explained, but the family's confessions are true. The family will be disgraced when news of their involvement in Eva's demise is revealed. The play ends abruptly with a telephone call, taken by Arthur, who reports that the body of a young woman has been found, a suspected case of suicide by disinfectant, and local police are on their way to question the Birlings. It is clear that Goole is never over it, but it is also clear that the identity of Eva Smith is never revealed, but that the true identities of the people named in the diary are never explained. In 1912, Arthur Birling, a wealthy mill owner and local politician, and his family are celebrating the engagement of daughter Sheila to Gerald Croft, son of a competitor of Birling's. In attendance are Sybil Birling,. Arthur's wife and Sheila and Eric's mother, and Eric, Sheila's younger brother, who has a drinking problem that is discreetly ignored. After dinner, Arthur speaks about the importance of self-reliance. A man, he says, must ""make his own way"" and protect his own interests. He denies responsibility for her death. He admits that he dismissed her 18 months ago for her involvement in an abortive workers' strike. Sheila enters the room and is drawn into the discussion. After prompting from Goole, she admits to recognizing Eva as well. She confesses that Eva served her in a department store and Sheila contrived to have her fired for an imagined slight. She admits that Eva's behaviour had been blameless and that the firing was motivated solely by Sheila's jealousy and spite towards a pretty working-class woman. Arthur and Sybil break down, and the family dissolves into screaming recriminations. Gerald is keen to resume his engagement to Sheila, but she is reluctant, since with or without a dead girl he still admitted to having an affair. Arthur makes a call to the Chief Constable, who confirms this. Gerald points out that as Goole was lying about being a policeman, there may be no dead girl. As an ashamed Gerald exits the room, Sheila acknowledges his nature and credits him for speaking truthfully but also signals that their engagement is over. The elder Birling and Gerald celebrate, with Arthur dismissing the evening's events as ""moonshine"" and ""bluffing"""
200,Ender's Game,"Ender Wiggin is part of an Earth program to produce brilliant officers. He is teased as a ""third"" under Earth's two-child policy. He has a close bond with his sister Valentine, but fears his brother Peter, a highly intelligent sociopath who delights in manipulating and tormenting him. In the far future, humanity has discovered interstellar travel and faster-than-light communication enabled by ansibles. In exploring the galaxy, they encountered an alien race known as the Formics, derogatorily dubbed ""buggers"" due to their insect-like appearance. The Formics attacked the humans and the two races enter into a series of wars. Despite political conflict on Earth between three ruling parties, the Hegemon, Polemarch, and Strategos, a tentative agreement was reached to create the International Fleet (IF) to combat the Formic. In addition to a selective breeding program, the IF monitors the children of Earth via implanted devices to find the best and brightest to enter Command School and enlist in the fleet.. Ender is soon promoted to Command School, skipping several years of schooling. In order to ensure Ender develops as a strong leader uninfluenced by his peers, Graff isolates him from the rest of the new cadets by acknowledging his intelligence and ridiculing his peers. Ender adapts by pitting virtual IF fleets under Ender's control against Formic fleets controlled by Mazer Rackham, as the simulations become harder. Though Ender had anticipated that breaking the rules would mean he would be expelled from the school, he discovers he will be celebrating the final test when he discovers his fleet is far-outnumbered by Formic forces. Despite being told that it was against the rules, Ender sacrifices most of his most of the fighters to launch a Molecular Disruption Device at the planet, destroying the entire Formic fleet and launching a Molecular Device to destroy the planet. He then returns to the IF, where he is told by several commanders, watching the simulation, that this is his final test and is told this is the reason he is being expelled from school. Ender returns and is given sub-command of the fleet, working alongside his jeesh, to work alongside the commanders, and to work to the end to save the planet from being destroyed by the Molecular Device. He later becomes friends with several of his cadets, forming ""Ender's Jeesh."" A fellow squad leader, Bonzo de Madrid, furious at Ender's victories, attacks Ender with the intent to kill him, and fatally wounds him."
201,Titus Andronicus,"The play begins shortly after the death of the Roman Emperor, with his two sons, Saturninus and Bassianus, squabbling over who will succeed him. A tribune announces that the people's choice for the new emperor is his brother, Titus, who will shortly return to Rome from a victorious ten-year campaign against the Goths. Distraught, Tamora and her two surviving sons, Demetrius and Chiron, vow revenge on Titus and his family. Meanwhile, Titus refuses the offer of the throne, arguing that he is not fit to rule, and instead supporting Saturninus' claim, who is duly elected. Saturninus tells Titus that for his first act as Emperor, he will marry Titus's daughter Lavinia. Titus agrees, although Lavinianus is already betrothed to BassianUS, who refuses to give her up. Aaron persuades Demetrious and. Chiron to kill Bassanus, so they may rape Lavinie. They do so, throwing Bassianu's body into a pit, and dragging LavinIA deep into the forest before violently raping her. Titus has Aaron cut off his hand and send it to the emperor, but in return, a messenger brings Titus Martius and Quintus' severed heads, along with Titus's severed left hand. Desperate for revenge, Titus orders Lucius to flee Rome and raise an army among their former enemy, the Gothics. Back in Rome, Titus's behaviour suggests he may have gone insane. Tamora, Chiron and Demetrius approach him, dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape, and offer him revenge on all of his enemies if he can convince Lucius to postpone the imminent attack on Rome. Revenge then offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora as well, when Titus insists that Rape and Murder (Chiron) stay with him. When Tamora is about to leave, Titus cuts their throats and drains their blood into a basin. When the Emperor calls for revenge for the rape for which they have been baked, Titus reveals that they have just been eating pie and kills Tamora. When Titus asks if he should kill his daughter when she has been raped, she answers that he should killing his father when she should kill him. Titus then kills her, telling her that he plans to cook the bones of their heads into powder and bake their heads in the pie. The next day, during the feast at his house, Titus asks Saturninus to marry his daughter. He reluctantly does."
202,Measure for Measure,"Vincentio, the Duke of Vienna, makes it known that he intends to leave the city on a diplomatic mission. He leaves the government in the hands of a strict judge, Angelo. Claudio, a young nobleman, is betrothed/unofficially married to Juliet. Angelo, as the personification of the law, decides to enforce the ruling that fornication is punishable by death. Since he does not accept the validity of the marriage, Claudio is sentenced to be executed. The Duke has not in fact left the city, but remains there disguised as a friar (Lodowick) in order to spy on the city's affairs, and especially on the actions of Angelo. In his guise as Friar Lodowick he befriends Isabella and arranges two tricks to thwart Angelo's evil intentions. This main plot concludes with the'return' to Vienna of the Duke as himself, and he hears their claims against Angelo, which Angelo smoothly denies. As a novice nun, Isabella feels that she cannot sacrifice her own immortal soul (and that of Claudio's, if he causes her to lose her virtue) to save his transient earthly life. This is one of the most common ""open silences"" of the play. A sub-plot concerns the friend, Lucio, who frequently slanders the duke to the friar, who only reveals that Claudio has not, in fact, been executed, relents, and proposes marriage to Isabella. Isabella does not reply, and her reaction is interpreted differently in different productions: her acceptance of his proposal is different in different ways. In some interpretations, this constitutes consummation of their betrothal, and therefore their marriage. In another interpretation, this is the same interpretation that assumes that ClAudio and Juliet are legally married, and that they are not legally married. In other interpretations, it is the other way around: Claudio and Juliet did not observe all the technicalities. This did not make them unique however; at the time most people (including the Church) would have considered them married. It is not known if the play has been performed in the UK or the U.S. since it was first performed in London in the 1970s and 1980s. It has been shown in the Netherlands and the UK in the 1990s and the United States in the 2000s, but not in Australia and the Netherlands in the last few years of the last decade."

207,Have Space Suit-Will Travel,"Clifford ""Kip"" Russell enters an advertising jingle writing contest, hoping to win an all-expenses-paid trip to the Moon. He instead gets an obsolete, but genuine, used space suit. Using his own ingenuity and determination, Kip puts the suit (which he dubs ""Oscar"") back into working condition. Kip reluctantly decides to return his space suit for a cash prize to help pay for college, but puts it on for one last walk. As he idly broadcasts on his shortwave radio, someone identifying herself as ""Peewee"" answers with a Mayday signal. He helps her home in on his location, and is shocked when a flying saucer lands practically on top of him. A young girl and an alien being (the ""Mother Thing"") debark, but all three are quickly captured and taken to the moon. Their captors are horrible-looking, vaguely anthropomorphic creatures who contemptuously refer to all others as ""animals"" Kip, Peewee, and the Mother Thing travel to a planet in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud, to face an intergalactic tribunal composed of many species which have banded together, which decides whether new races pose a danger. The Wormfaces are put on trial first. They promise to annihilate all other species, and are judged to be dangerous. Their planet is rotated out of three-dimensional space without their star, most likely to freeze. It is decided to re-evaluate humanity after ""a dozen half-lives of radium"". (The half–life ofRadium-226 is 1601 years.) Kip makes a stirring speech. The Mother Thing and a representative of another race argue that the short-lived species are essentially children who should be granted more time to learn and grow. Then it is humanity's turn to face the tribunal, as represented by Peewees, Kipper, Iunio (a Roman centurion), and a Neanderthal man. In humanity's defense, Kips' speech is admitted into evidence. The tribunal rejects the Neanderthal as being of another species, but Kip proves belligerent, but brave. The pair are returned to Earth with devices and equations provided by Professor Vegans. After listening to Kip's story, Reisfeld arranges a full scholarship for Kip to study engineering and spacesuit design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Kip wants to study design and engineering."
208,Requiem,"The story centers around Delos David Harriman, the lead character of ""The Man Who Sold The Moon"" He had always dreamed of going to the Moon, and had spent much of his career and resources making space flight a practical commercial enterprise. Unfortunately, his business partners prevented him from taking the early flights (as shown in the novella) Now an old man, he has still not been to the moon, a fact that frustrates him, since he lives in a world where space travel is so commonplace that carnivals have their own barnstorming spacecraft. No longer bound by his contractual obligations, he is now too old; he is unable to pass the medical examination needed for space travel. He bribes two spacemen to help him get to theMoon after encountering them at a funfair in Butler, a small town outside Kansas City, Missouri, where they sell rides on their old, somewhat run-down ship. The three of them fight many obstacles, including Harrima's heirs, who want him declared mentally incompetent or senile before he can spend their inheritance. In the end, he finally makes it to Moon, only to die on the surface soon after landing, content at finally having reached his goal. His body is left there, with his epitaph scrawled on the tag from an oxygen bottle. It is Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Requiem"", which is inscribed on his own headstone in Samoa. :Under the wide and starry sky :Dig the grave and let me lie: :Glad did I live and gladly die, :And I laid me down with a will! :This be the verse you grave for me: :Here he lies where he longed to be; :Home is the sailor, home from the sea, :and the hunter home from a hill.  The town of Butler is Heinlein's birthplace, and it is also where he wrote the novel ""The City on the Edge of the Moon"", which was published in 1950. It was published by Simon & Schuster, which is now a division of Penguin Books, and is based on the book ""The Moon"" by Robert A. Heinlein, published by Random House, in which Heinlein wrote about his experiences on the Moon in the 1950s and 1960s. The book is available in hardback and e-book versions for $24.99 each, with the option to buy a hardback version for $25.99. The hardback edition includes a copy of the novel's first chapter, as well as a foreword by Heinlein."
209,Red Planet,"Jim Marlowe and Frank Sutton travel to the Lowell Academy boarding school for the start of the academic year. Jim takes along his native, volleyball-sized pet, Willis the Bouncer, who is about as intelligent as a human child and has a photographic memory for sounds. At school, Jim gets into trouble with the authoritarian headmaster, Mr. Howe, who confiscates Willis, claiming that it is against the new rules to have pets. When Jim and Frank sneak into Howe's office and rescue Willis, the bouncer repeats two overheard conversations between Howe and Beecher, the unscrupulous colonial administrator of Mars. The boys run away from school to warn their parents and the colony. After two colonists are killed trying to surrender, and the power to the building is cut, the colonists decide they have no choice but to fight back. The colonists organize a raiding party, with the boys taking part, capture Beechers office and proclaim the colony's independence from the Earth. Dr. MacRae negotiates with the Martians, and is able to persuade them to let the colonists stay, mainly because of Jim's strong friendship with Willis. In the end, Jim resigns himself to giving Willis up so he can undergo the transformation to adulthood. As with Podkayne of Mars, there are two versions of the ending. As originally written (and published much later) it is made clear that Willis will not emerge as an adult for forty years. This was edited and changed by Heinlein's publishers, as was a discussion early in the novel in which Macrae expresses strong support for adults and older children being free to carry handguns, and opposition to any government which would restrict that. The Martians had been content to allow humans to share their planet, but Beecer's threat to Willis has made them reconsider. They present the colonists with an ultimatum: leave the planet or else. The next day, they accept Jim because of his relationship to Willis and water-friendship with Gekko. The Martian treat Frank's illness and send the two boys home by a swift ""subway"" The next morning, they meet some native Martians who accept Jim. They also share water with a group of its fellows. The three-legged alien takes the boys and Willis to join a ritual called ""growing together"" with aGroup of its fellow Martians. The two boys set out to skate the thousands of miles to their homes on the frozen Martian canals. On the third night, they are forced to take shelter inside a giant Martian cabbage plant."
210,The Number of the Beast,"The book is a series of diary entries by each of the four main characters. The names ""Dejah Thoris"", ""Burroughs"", and ""Carter"" are overt references to the main protagonists of the Barsoom (Mars) novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs. The four travel in Zebadiah's spaceship Gay Deceiver, which is equipped with the professor's ""continua"" device and armed by the Australian Defence Force. The continua device allows travel into various fictional universes, such as the Land of Oz, as well as through time. In the novel, the Biblical number of the beast turns out to be, not 666, but (6^6)^6, or 10,314,424,798,490,535,546,171,949,056. The geometry of the novel's universe contains six dimensions; the three spatial dimensions known to the real world, and three time dimensions - t (tau), and т (teh). The continUA device can travel on all six axes. An attempt to visit Bar soom takes them to an apparently different version of Mars seemingly under the colonial rule of the British Empire. But near the end of the book, Lazarus Long hints that they had traveled to Barsooom, and that its ""colonial"" status was an illusion imposed on them by the telepathically adept Bar Soomians. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, which also publishes the film version of this novel, which was released in September 2013. The film version is published in hardback and hardback, with a cover price of $24.99. The novel is available in hardcover and paperback versions of $25.99 and $35.99 respectively. The movie version is also available in softcover and hardcover versions of both of the books, with prices ranging from $25 to $50. The DVD version of the film is available for $39.99, and the Blu-Ray version is $49.99 (with the option of a DVD of the movie version for $59.99). The book was released on September 25, 2013, and is available on Blu-ray and DVD in the U.S. and Canada. The UK release date for the book is September 28, 2013. It is also the 30th anniversary of the release of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King by Robert A. Heinlein. The US release date is September 29, 2013; the UK release dates are September 30, 2013 and September 31, 2014."
211,Foundation's Edge,"Five hundred years after the establishment of the Foundation, the Mayor of Terminus, Harla Branno, is basking in a political glow. Golan Trevize, a former officer of the Navy and now a member of Council, believes the Second Foundation (which is almost universally thought to be extinct) still exists and is controlling events. He attempts to question the continued existence of the Seldon Plan during a Council session and is arrested on a charge of treason. As a cover, he is to be accompanied by Janov Pelorat, a professor of Ancient History and mythologist, who is interested in the location of Earth, the fabled homeworld of humanity. They are provided a highly advanced computer controlled 'gravitic' ship with which to carry out their mission. Traveling to Gaia, they discover that it is a'superorganism', where all things, including humans, participate in a larger, group consciousness, while still retaining any individual awareness they might have. As Golan falls in love with a Gaian woman named Blissenobi, who explains that the future of the galaxy will be decided by the Foundation or by Gaia (who envisions an eventual extension of its consciousness to the entire galaxy, thus forming the new entity Galaxia). Once she joins the First Foundation, Gendibal is met by a First Foundation agent, who reveals herself as an agent of Gaia. Once she reveals herself, she reveals her powers as a shield against the Mayor's mental force, and becomes an agent herself as well. The book ends with a battle between the First and Second Foundation, commanded by First Foundation agents, in which both sides are victorious. The film was released on September 25, 2013. It is the 50th anniversary of the foundation's establishment. It has been described as one of the most anticipated sci-fi films of all time, and is expected to be watched by some of the world's most popular sci-fiction series, including The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Lord Of The Rings: The Return of the Jedi, as well as the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The Dark Knight Rises, among other films. The movie is based on a novel written by Neil Gaiman and published by Simon & Schuster, titled ""The Second Foundation"" The film is scheduled to be released on November 26, 2013, and will be followed by a sequel, ""Second Foundation: The Third Foundation"""
212,The Caves of Steel,"The book's central crime is a murder, which takes place before the novel opens. Elijah must work with a Spacer partner, a highly advanced robot named R. Daneel Olivaw. One interesting aspect of the book is the contrast between Elijah, the human detective, and Daneel, the humanoid robot. Asimov uses the ""mechanical"" robot to inquire about human nature. In the concluding scene, Daneel exhibits a sense of morality. He argues that the captured murderer be treated leniently, telling his human companions that he now realizes the destruction of evil is less desirable than the conversion of evil into good. Quoting the Pericope Adulteræ, Daneal tells the murderer, ""Go, and sin no more!"" The book is published by Simon & Schuster at a price of $24.99.

The story is about Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, an Ambassador for the Spacer planet of Spacetown. He is found dead outside his home, his chest imploded by an energy blaster. The New York police commissioner charges Elijah with finding the murderer. Elijah, like many Earth residents, has a low opinion of robots. Together, they search for the murderer and try to avert an interstellar diplomatic incident."
213,Prelude to Foundation,"The story takes place on Trantor during the reign of Emperor Cleon I. It starts with Hari's presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how practical use of psychohistory might theoretically be possible. The Emperor of the Galactic Empire learns of this and wants to use Hari for political gain. Hari then meets reporter Chetter Hummin, who convinces him that Cleon's first minister Eto Demerzel is attempting to capture him, and that it is therefore imperative for Hari to escape. Thus, Hari goes on his ""Flight"" and is introduced to Dors Venabili by Hummin. The pair move to Mycogen, where Hari tries to work out his psychohistsory with the knowledge that the MyCogenians supposedly possess. The finale reveals that ""Hummin"" is in fact the robot R. Daneel Olivaw. By the end of the novel,. Hari suspects that Dors is a robot, too. This theme would later be picked up in Forward the Foundation. Towards the end, Hara, Dors, and Raych are kidnapped by agents from Wye, a powerful sector. While in Dahl they meet a guttersnipe named Raych (whom Hari later adopts as his son), and Yugo Amaryl (who would become Hari’s partner in developing psychohism) Hari asks for the book but Raindrop Forty-three accepts on the condition that Hari allows her to touch his hair. When Hari starts reading the book, he finds it disappointing except for the revealing of what the Mycogenicians call their home planet, Aurora. The book also reveals that the People of Aurora are called ""Aurora"" Hari and Dors are almost killed when they try to find what they suspect are a robot in the My cogenian ""temple"" until Hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them. The action then shifts to the Dahl sector, where Dors displays her amazing knife fighting skills, and Hari is later adopted as a son by a Guttersnipes called Raych, who later becomes his partner, Yugo. The novel ends with a cliffhanger, in which Hari learns that Raych is actually the son of the gutterednipe called Yugo, and he is taken hostage by Wye's agents. The story ends in Dahl, where the pair are rescued by the Gutterman, who would later become Hara's partner, Raych."
214,Foundation and Earth,"Councilman Golan Trevize, historian Janov Pelorat, and Blissenobiarella of the planet Gaia set out on a journey to find humanity's ancestral planet &mdash; Earth. They journey to Comporellon, which claims to be the oldest currently-inhabited planet in the galaxy. While there, they find the coordinates of three Spacer planets. Since the Spacers were the first colonists from Earth back in the ancient days of space travel, it is surmised that their planets would be fairly close to Earth. As well as giving them another 47 Spacer worlds that they could visit, they now have a vital clue to where Earth may be found. They find a remnant of the inhabitants of Earth, who many millennia ago were resettled there. There is a reference back to the events of Asimov's novel Pebble Sky: The restoration of Earth's soil. Later we learn that Earth was indeed attempted but was too uninhabitable, with there being a grand project to 'form a terraforming project' This project was a grand. project to terraform Earth, but it was abandoned too soon, and there was a great deal of damage done to the planet. We learn that the restoration of the soil was attempted, but was indeed abandoned too quickly, with the soil becoming too uninformable, and the terraformed project failing. We also learn that there was an attempt to restore the soil of Earth but that this was also abandoned. This is the reason for the grand project, and why the Earth is still uninhabited today. It is also the reason that the Earth-like planet of Melpomenia is the only one left in the universe that has not been colonised by humans. It has been ruled by a race of hermaphrodite beings, who have remained generally intolerant of human physical presence or contact. The Solarians intentionally avoid ever having to interact with each other, except by holographic apparatus (""viewing""), and reproduce only when necessary to replace someone who has died. They have also given themselves a natural ability to mentally channel (""transduce"") great amounts of energy, and utilize this as their sole source of power. They also find that the atmosphere has become depressurized to a few thousandths of normal atmospheric pressure, and find a statue, as well as writings with the coordinates on all of the Spacer world. They set their blasters to minimum power to fry it off, and then set the ship to heavy UV-illumination before stepping on."
215,Time Enough for Love,"Lazarus Long is the oldest living human, now more than two thousand years old. The first half of the book takes the form of several novellas connected by Lazarus's retrospective narrative. In the concluding tale, Lazarus attempts to travel backward in time to 1919 in order to experience it as an adult; but an error in calculation places Lazarus in 1916 on the eve of America's involvement in World War I. There are also two ""Intermission"" sections, each some six or eight pages long. These were later published independently, with illustrations, as The Notebooks of Lazarus Long. The book was written in the style of ""The Song of Hiawatha"" and has been described as a reverse Arabian Nights scenario. It was published by Simon & Schuster, which has also published other works by the author, such as ""The Book of the Dead"" and ""The Secret of the Moon"" (both published in the U.S. by Simon and Schuster), and in Europe by Macmillan, which published it in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. It is the first of a series of books based on the life of Lazarus, which are planned to be published in a number of different languages, including English, French, German, and Spanish. The author has no plans to publish a sequel to the book, although he has said that he would like to do so in the future, if he can find a way to make money from it. He has no children of his own, but has fathered several children with other people, including two clones of himself, who are now living on a new planet with a larger number of children. He also has a daughter, Dora, who he marries, and the two become founders of a new settlement where Lazarus' long life is less likely to be noticed. Because Dora is not a Howard Family member, she eventually dies of old age, leaving Lazarus to mourn her loss. He later falls in love with his own mother, Maureen, and enlists in the army to retain her esteem and that of his grandfather. While in France, he is mortally wounded in the trenches of the Western Front, but rescued by those with whom he appears in Boondock and returned to his own time. At the end of the story, he reveals a belief that they are descendants of him and his grandfather, and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business. He then moves to another planet and establishes a polyamorous family consisting of three men, three women, and a largernumber of children, two of whom are female clones of Lazarus himself."

217,The Door into Summer,"The novel opens in 1970 with Daniel Boone Davis, an engineer and inventor, well into a long drinking binge. He has lost his company, Hired Girl, Inc., to his partner Miles Gentry and the company bookkeeper, Belle Darkin. She had been Dan's fiancée, deceiving him into giving her enough voting stock to allow her and Miles to seize control. Wishing to stay independent, Dan opposes the takeover, but is outvoted and then fired as Chief Engineer. Left with a large financial settlement, he elects to take ""cold sleep"" (suspended animation) with his beloved pet cat ""Pete"", hoping to wake up thirty years later to a brighter future. Dan wakes up in the year 2000, with no money to his name, and no idea how to find the people he once knew. He discovers that Miles died in 1972, while Belle is a shrill and gin-sodden wreck. All she recalls is that Ricky went to live with her grandmother about the time Dan went into cold sleep. Dan tracks her to Yuma, Arizona, where she was apparently married. When Dan looks at the marriage register, he finds that she married ""Daniel Boone Davis"". He immediately empties his bank account and heads for Colorado. In Boulder, he befriends Dr. Twitchell, a once-brilliant scientist reduced to drinking away his frustrations. Eventually, just as Chuck had told him, he admits to having created a time machine of sorts. With the machine powered up, Dan goes back to 1970, some months before his confrontation with Miles and Belle. Dan is befriended by John and Jenny Sutton and persuades them to help him in his mission. He then creates Dan, which he then uses to design a new version of Eager Beaver, the first version of Flexible Frank, to be called ""Aladdin Auto-engineering"" Destroying the machine, he heads out to Los Angeles, and sets up a new corporation called Protean Protester. Dan then takes his own car and uses it to remove all his engineering drawings and parts from Miles's garage and all his drawings from the garage. He returns to the summer of 2000 to meet Ricky, who is remarkably mature for her age, and asks her if she would like to go to camp with him. Ricky says she would. Dan returns to LA to meet her and they set up a camp for her, and he asks her to be his Scout."
218,Farnham's Freehold,"Hugh Farnham, a middle-aged man, holds a bridge club party for his wife Grace, son Duke, daughter Karen (a college student), and Barbara (Karen's sorority sister) The group, along with Joe (the family's African American servant), retreat to the fallout shelter below the house. After several apparently nuclear explosions rock the shelter, Hugh and Barbara become romantically involved. After their copulation, the largest explosion of all hits the shelter. With only minor injuries, the group decides to ensure that they can leave the shelter when necessary. Upon exiting through an emergency tunnel, they find themselves in a completely undamaged, semi-tropical region apparently uninhabited by humans or other sentient creatures. Several of the group think the final explosion somehow forced them into an alternate dimension. The group strives to stay alive as a pioneer family, with Hugh as the leader (despite friction between Hugh and Duke) They survive the war, then spend the rest of their lives trying to make sure the future they experienced does not come to pass. They return just prior to the original nuclear attack, and flee in Barbara's car. As they drive, they realize that while Barbara had driven a car with an automatic transmission, this car - the same car in every respect but one - has a manual transmission, and Farnham deduces that the time-travel experiment worked, but sent them back to their own time. They are captured by people of clear African ancestry, but is spared execution when Joe intervenes by conversation with their captives' leader in French. They find that it has not been transported to another world, but instead is in the distant future of their own world. A decadent but technologically advanced African culture keeps either uneducated or castrated whites as slaves. Each of the characters adapts to the sudden black/white role reversal in different and sometimes shocking ways. Karen eventually dies during her labor, due to complications, and her infant daughter follows the next day. In the end, Hugh, Barbara fail to adjust to the new situation and attempt to escape, but are captured. Rather than execute them, Ponse (the ""Lord Protector"" of the house to which they have become slaves) asks them to volunteer (though they speculate that if they didn't volunteer they would have been forced to anyway) for a time- travel experiment to send them back into their ownTime. The film was released on September 14, 1998. It is the first of a two-part series."
219,The Maltese Falcon,"Sam Spade and Miles Archer are hired by a Miss Wonderly to follow a man, Floyd Thursby, who has allegedly run off with Wonderly's younger sister. That night, Spade receives a phone call telling him that Archer is dead. Spade is visited by Joel Cairo, who offers Spade $5,000 if he can retrieve a figurine of a black bird that has recently arrived in San Francisco. The figurine was a gift from the Knights of Malta to the King of Spain, but was lost in transit. It was covered with fine jewels, but acquired a layer of black enamel to conceal its value. The latter pair stole the figurine, but kept it, and gave it to Casper Gutman, who traced it to a Russian general Kemidov, who sent Cairo, Thursby and O'Shaughnessy to retrieve it. When Spade returns to his office, Captain Jacobi of the La Paloma arrives, drops a package on the floor, and then dies. After Spade opens the package, and finds the falcon, he receives a call from O' ShaughnessY, asking for his help. He stores the item at a bus station luggage counter and mails himself the collection tag. He finds a drugged girl, her stomach scratched by a pin in order to keep her awake. She gives him information about Brigid, but it is a false lead. When he returns to the address, he finds a man named Wilmer Cook, who tells him that his boss, ""G,"" will have to deal with Spade. He takes the money, but says that they need to take the blame for the murders for the fake figurine. He realizes that the Russian must have discovered its true value and made a copy of his copy of Gutman's copy of the original. He gives it to Gutman to give to Spade's secretary and asks her to pick up the figurines. He then calls his secretary to pick it up and gives her the $10,000 he gave Gutman for the real value of the bird. The next day, Archer's wife Iva asks Spade if he killed Miles. He tells her to leave, and orders his secretary Effie Perine to remove all of Archer's belongings from the office. Later that night, Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy visit Spade to inquire about his recent whereabouts, and say that Thursby was also killed and that Spade was a suspect. They have no evidence against Spade, but tell him that they will be conducting an investigation into the matter."

224,Whit,"Isis, otherwise The Blessed Very Reverend Gaia-Marie Isis Saraswati Minerva Mirza Whit of Luskentyre, Beloved Elect of God III, is the 19-year-old granddaughter and designated spiritual heir of Salvador Whit, patriarch of the cult. They are a religious cult who live in a commune in Stirlingshire and reject most technology. They run their lives according to a collection of beliefs and rituals ""revealed"" to Salvador after he washed ashore on Harris in the Western Isles and ""married"" two young Asian ladies (Aasni and Zhobelia Asis). (Haggis pakora becomes a staple of the Cult's cuisine.) The novel opens shortly before the Luskteenrian Festival of Love, held every four years, about nine months before every leap year day (29 February) The Luskyerrians believe that those born on that day have special power. This includes Isis herself, and expected to take over leadership of thecult. The bulk of the novel tells of Isis' voyages in the world of ""the Unsaved"" (also known as ""the Obtuse"", ""the Wretched"", "" the Bland"" and ""the Asleep"") She finds out that her grandfather was Moray Black, a robber on the run, and that the cult he set up is based on lies. Isis also learns the history of her grandfather, and rescues her great-aunt Zhob Amelia from an old people's home. The story now takes a more sinister turn, as we learn that Isis' brother seems to have cooked up her impossible mission in an attempt to discredit her and put her out of the picture in a bid totake over the leadership ofThe cult. Isis' maternal grandmother, Yolanda, a feisty Texan woman, appears and lends her support to Isis' quest. She also meets her whenever she goes to her house to use theLuskentyrian method of free (if laborious) telephone communication, using coded rings. When Isis finds Morag, she learns that though Morag has lapsed somewhat in her LuskTwentyrian practices (her work as a porn actress is not inconsistent with the cult's beliefs) she had every intention of returning for the festival. This normally results in being allowed to get off at the next stop and pointed in the right direction. This consists of getting on buses, and when the conductor comes along, asking for a ticket in the opposite direction while looking confused."
225,Mostly Harmless,"After the events in So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, Arthur Dent and his love interest Fenchurch attempt to sightsee across the Galaxy. Ford Prefect has returned to the offices of the Hitchhikers' Guide, and is annoyed to find out the original publishing company, Megadodo Publications, has been taken over by InfiniDim Enterprises. Meanwhile, an alternative version of Trillian, who never was able to take Zaphod Beeblebrox's offer to travel in space due to wanting to get her handbag, finds herself approached by an extraterrestrial species calling themselves the Grebulons. They reveal that they have set up a base on Rupert (a tenth planet just beyond the orbit of Pluto) after arriving in the Solar System and finding that their computer core and most of their memories had been damaged. They have been following the remaining portions of their mission statement to observe the most interesting things in the system. It is revealed that the Guide Mk. II was created by the Vogons to complete the destruction of the Earth in every possible dimension, using reverse temporal engineering to bring Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Random together for its destruction. After the Earth is destroyed, the Guide collapses in on itself in on Earth, but Arthur is able to save it from the GreBulons' clutches and return it to its rightful owner, the HitchHiker's Guide Mk.-II. The Guide Mk-II is also capable of both time-travel and looking into alternate universes, but Ford realizes that it is manipulating events in accordance with an unknown plan. In the end, Ford and Arthur manage to leave the planet and return to Earth, realizing that Random has also returned there. Trillian leaves Random with Arthur so that she can better pursue her new career as an intergalactic reporter. She is then called to report on a spaceship landing in the middle of London. Tricia finds Random leaving the ship, and the girl believes Tricia to be her mother, and starts yelling at her. However, she manages to take Random to a bar (address number 42) to try to talk to her. She fires a weapon at Arthur; Arthur ducks and the shot kills a man behind him. Ford points out to Arthur that the name of the bar they're in is ""Stavro Mueller's Beta"", the man just killed being another form of Agrajag, and that Arthur's life is no longer safe, a point at which Arthur takes relief."
226,The Lion in Winter,"The Lion in Winter is set during Christmas 1183 at Henry II of England's castle in Chinon, Anjou, Angevin Empire. The play opens with the arrival of Henry's wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, whom he has had imprisoned since 1173. The story concerns the gamesmanship between Henry, Eleanor, their three surviving sons Richard, Geoffrey, and John, and their Christmas Court guest, the King of France, Philip II Augustus. Also involved is Philip's half-sister Alais, who has been at court since she was betrothed to Richard at age eight, but has since become Henry's mistress. The Lion in winter is fictional and none of the dialogue and actions is historical; there was not a Christmas Court at Chinon in 1183. However, the events leading up to the story are generally accurate. The real Henry had many mistresses (and several illegitimate children). There is no definitive evidence that Alais wasHenry's mistress (although Richard later resisted marrying Alais on the basis of this claim). The real King of England had several mistresses and illegitimate children as well as several legitimate children. There was not an English Christmas Court in 11 83. The King of Britain had no Christmas Court until 1183, and there was no English Christmas in 1182 or 1183 until 1187 or 1188. The king of France had a Christmas court in 1181 and 1182, but not 1183 or 1182. The kings of England and France had Christmas courts in 1180 and 1181, and the king of England in 1187 and 1188, but 1183 was the year of the Hundred Years' War (1170-1215). The king's Christmas Court was held in 1184 and 1187. The monarchs of England, France, and Germany had Christmas parties in December and January each year. The Christmas Court of 1183 is the first Christmas since 1181. It is also the last Christmas of the reign of Louis VII of France (by his third wife, Adelaide) and his son Louis VII II Augustus, who was the son of Eleanor's ex-husband, Louis VII, by his third marriage, Adelaide. It was also the first time Henry had been married to a woman other than his wife, and he had no children of his own. Henry was married to Alais from 1173 to 1184, and later to his second wife, Alize, from 1188 to 1189, and to Alise again from 1189 to 1190."
227,Native Son,"Bigger Thomas lives with his family in Chicago, Illinois. He gets a job as a chauffeur at a wealthy family's house. The family's daughter, Mary, is a Communist. Bigger drives Mary around and meets her Communist boyfriend, Jan. Mary is so drunk that Bigger has to carry her to her bedroom when they arrive home. He is terrified someone will see him with her in his arms, but he cannot resist the temptation of the forbidden, and he kisses her. Mary dies and Bigger decides to burn her body in the house's furnace. He adds extra coal to the furnace, and after decapitating her with a nearby hatchet, Bigger finally puts the corpse to burn, and goes home to his girlfriend, Bessie. Mr. Britten, a private detective, finds the boy and his girlfriend in the same room and confronts them with their conflicting stories. Mr Britten interrogates Bigger but vouches for Bigger for the events of the previous evening in a calculated way to throw suspicion on Jan, knowing Mr Dalton dislikes Jan because he is a communist. The boy and the Communist boy's story are told in a way that makes it seem like Jan is the one who is to blame for the death of Mary, and not Bigger, who is the only one responsible for it.

The film is available on Blu-ray, DVD and Blu-Ray, and for the first time in the U.S. in the US on September 14, 2013. The movie is available for $16.95. The novel is about Bigger Thomas and his friends, G. H. and Jack, who plan a robbery of the white wealth. They are attracted to the world of wealthy whites in the newsreel and feel strangely moved by the tom-toms and the primitive black people in the film, but they also feel that they are equal to those worlds. The fight ends any chance of the robbery occurring; Bigger is obscurely conscious that he has done this intentionally. The story ends on a cliffhanger, with Bigger's friend Gusiffer R. telling Bigger that every time he thinks about whites, he feels something terrible will happen to him. It is published on September 15, 2013, by Simon and Schuster for a limited release of $15.99 (with a limited run of 2,500 copies)."

He then falls for the lures of the High Church (and is duped out of much of his own money by a fellow clergyman) He decides that the way to regenerate the Church of England is to live among the poor, but the results are, first, that his faith in the integrity of the Bible is severely damaged by a conversation with one of the poor he was hoping to redeem. He attempts a sexual assault on a woman he had incorrectly believed to be of loose morals. This assault leads to a prison term. His parents disown him. As he recovers he learns how to tailor and decides to make this his profession once out of prison.

On their extensive travels across Europe they are soon caught up in vastly different lifestyles. Fran falls in with a crowd of frivolous socialites, while Sam plays more of an independent tourist. Their marriage comes to an end, when she falls in love with Kurt von Obersdorf in Berlin. Whereas she stays on with her new love, he criss-crosses Europe in an attempt to cope with his new situation. When Sam happens to run into Edith in Venice, she persuades him to accompany her on a visit to a village in the vicinity of Naples. As Fran's fiancé calls off the wedding, Sam joins his former wife on her voyage back to New York. Only three days later he is back on the next ship to meet Edith on a trip to Paris.

Sam ambles along as a stranger in a strange land until the epiphany of getting on with his life hits him in the last act. He is a rare Lewis character: a man of true conviction and purpose. Purpose and conviction can be relied on significantly as the book (and film) concludes with the two main characters going in quite different directions.

When he decides to go back to America for his college reunion in New Haven, Fran spends the summer months on the lakes near Montreux and Stresa,. where she has a romance with Arnold Israel. Once Sam has picked her up in Paris, they agree to continue their travels together, touring France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Hungary and Germany."
236,Lost Horizon,"In May 1931, during the British Raj in India, the 80 white residents of Baskul are being evacuated to Peshawar, owing to a revolution. In the airplane of the Maharajah of Chandrapore are Conway, the British consul, age 37; Mallinson, his young vice-consul; an American, Barnard; and a British missionary, Miss Brinklow. The plane is hijacked and flown instead over the mountains to Tibet. After a crash landing, the pilot dies, but not before telling the four (in Chinese, which Conway knows) to seek shelter at the nearby lamasery of Shangri-La. The four are taken there by a party directed by Chang, a postulant at the lamasary who speaks English. The lamasry has modern conveniences, like central heating; bathtubs from Akron, Ohio; a large library; a grand piano; a harpsichord; and food from the fertile valley below. Once they have done so, their aging slows; if they then leave the valley, they age quickly and die. Conway is given an audience with the High Lama, an unheard-of honor. The High Lama reveals that he is finally dying, and that he wants Conway to lead the Lamasery. Meanwhile, Mallinson has arranged to leave the Valley with porters and Lo-Tsen, and he cannot traverse the dangerous route by himself, so he convinces Conway to go along. This ends Rutherford's manuscript. The last time Rutherford saw Conway, it appeared he was preparing to make his way back to the valley. The others eventually decide they are content to stay: Miss Brinkslow, to teach the people a sense of sin; Barnard, because he is really Chalmers Bryant (wanted by the police for stock fraud) and because he was keen to develop the gold-mines in the valley; Conway, because the contemplative scholarly life suits him. Rutherford completes his account by telling the neurologist that he attempted to track Conway and verify some of his claims. He found the Chung-Kiang doctor who had treated Conway. The doctor said Conway had been brought in by a Chinese woman who was ill and died soon after. She was old, the doctor had told Rutherford, ""Most of anyone I have ever seen"", implying that she was aged and died drastically by her departure from Shangri -La. Rutherford wrote down Conway's story; he gives the manuscript to a neurologist and that manuscript becomes the heart of the novel."

238,"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","The novel tells the story of a much-beloved schoolteacher and his long tenure at Brookfield, a fictional British boys' public boarding school. Mr. Chipping conquers his inability to connect with his students, as well as his initial shyness, when he marries Katherine. When World War I breaks out, Chips, who had retired the year before at age 65, agrees to come out of retirement to fill in for the various masters who have entered military service. Despite his being taken for a doddering fossil, it is Chips who keeps his wits about him during an air raid, averting mass panic and sustaining morale. At one point, he reads aloud a long roster of the school's fallen alumni, and, defying the modern world he sees as soulless and lacking transcendent values of honour and friendship, dares to include the name of a German former master who has died fighting on the opposite side. He is seen as an individual who is able to connect to anyone on a human level, beyond what he (by proxy of his late wife) views as petty politics, such as the strikers, the Boers, and a German friend. Clearly discernible is a nostalgia for the Victorian social order that had faded rapidly after Queen Victoria's death in 1901 and whose remnants were destroyed by the First World War. Indeed, a recurring motif is the devastating impact of the war on British society. The book is unabashedly sentimental, but it also depicts the sweeping social changes that Chips experiences throughout his life: he begins his tenure atBrookfield in 1870, as the Franco-Prussian War is breaking out and lies on his deathbed shortly after Adolf Hitler's rise to power. It is the first of a series of books about the life of Mr Chipping, which will be published in the spring of 2015.

239,Of Mice and Men,"George Milton and Lennie Small are migrant field workers in California during the Great Depression. They hope to one day attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend to (and touch) soft rabbits on the farm. They are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed, California, where they were run out of town. It soon becomes clear that the two are close friends and George is Lennie’s protector. The theme of friendship is constant throughout the story. The pair are confronted by Curley, the boss's small-statured aggressive son with an inferiority complex who dislikes larger men. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and is especially harsh towards Crooks because of his race, threatening to have him lynched. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie and shoots him in the back of the head, so that his death will be painless. Only George realizes that Lennie killed himself out of love of love, and will look on the two men look on, unable to comprehend the mood of subdued mood of the men. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the bright future together that they will never share. George hurries away to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated at the start of the novel in case Lennie got into trouble, knowing that there is only one thing he can do to save Lennie from the painful death thatCurley's lynch mob intends to deliver. George meets Lennie at the designated place, the same spot they camped in the night before they came to the ranch. George finds Lennie seconds after Curley and Slim, Slim, and Carlson find George seconds after the shooting. George leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. In spite of the potential problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy, the aged, one-handed ranch hand, offers to buy a farm at the end of the month in return for permission to live with them on it. In sharp contrast to these two characters, the pair also meets Slim, the kind, intelligent and intuitive jerkline skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. In the scuffle, Lennie unintentionally breaks her neck, unintentionally breaking her neck."

She is hopelessly in love with Count Bertram, who has been sent to the court of the King of France. When word comes that the King is ill, she goes to Paris and, using her father's arts, cures the fistula from which he suffers. In return, she is given the hand of any man in the realm; she chooses Bertram. Her new husband is appalled at the match, and shortly after their marriage flees France, accompanied only by a scoundrel named Parolles, to fight in the army of the Duke of Florence. Meanwhile, in Florence, Bertram has become a general in the Duke's army. Helena comes to the city, and discovers that her husband is trying to seduce Diana, the virginal daughter of the kindly widow.

Bertram is at a loss to explain where it came from, but just then Diana and her mother appear to explain the trickery—followed by Helena.

The story ends with Helena, who informs Bertram that he will never be her true spouse unless she can get his family ring from his finger, and become pregnant with his child — neither of which, he declares, will ever come to pass. The wise Countess, who loves Helena and approves of the match,. tries to comfort her, but the distraught young woman departs Rous Dillon, planning to make a religious pilgrimage.

241,The Taming of the Shrew,"Katherina Minola is the eldest daughter of Baptista Minola, a lord in Padua. Two men – Hortensio and Gremio – are eager to marry her younger sister Bianca. Baptista has sworn not to allow his younger daughter to marry before Katherina is wed, much to the despair of her suitors. The plot becomes more complex when Lucentio, who has recently come to Padua to attend university, sees Bianca and instantly falls in love with her.

The play ends with Katherine and Petruchio being engaged to each other in a farcical ceremony during which he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine, and then takes her home against her will. In the end, the play is a comedy of errors, with the playwright admitting that he is not the author of the play, but the play's author, Christopher Sly, who is a drunkard named Christopher Sly who is tricked into believing he is a lord. It was performed for Sly by the troupe of actors from the School of Music at the University of Padua, and was first performed in the spring of 18th century.

242,Our Town,"The Stage Manager guides the play, taking questions from the audience, describing the locations and making key observations about the world the play creates. The Stage Manager introduces the audience to the small town of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, and its residents as a morning begins in 1901. We meet the undertaker, Joe Stoddard, and a young man Sam Craig who has returned home for his cousin's funeral. We learn that his cousin is Emily, who died giving birth to her and George's second child. The funeral ends and Emily emerges to join the dead. Despite the warnings of Simon, Mrs. Soames, and Mrs. Gibbs, Emily decides to return to Earth to re-live just one day, her 12th birthday. She finally finds it too painful, and realizes just how much life should be valued, ""every, every minute"" Poignantly, she asks the Stage Manager whether anyone realizes life while they live it, and is told, ""No. The saints and poets, maybe – they do some."" She then returns to her grave, beside Mrs. Webb, watching impassively as George kneels weeping at her graveside. The stage manager concludes the play by reflecting on the probable lack of life beyond Earth, and wishes the audience a good night. The play ends on a note that a copy of this play will be placed inside a time capsule in the cornerstone of a new bank in town, and noting the lack of information about the common people of ancient cultures, he resolves that this play should be placed in the time capsule. The time capsule is due to be laid at the beginning of the next century, when George and Emily are about to be married, but George is nervous about the wedding. The audience is taken back in time to the end of Emily's junior year, when she confronts George about his pride, and over an ice cream soda, they discuss the future and their love for each other. George resolves not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. The wedding follows where George, in a fit of nervousness, tells his mother that he is not ready to marry. The characters who died in the nine years since Act Two: Mrs Gibbs (pneumonia, while traveling), Wally Webb (burst appendix, while camping), Mrs Soames and Simon Stimson (suicide by hanging), among others, among others. We also meet Joe Crowell, who is delivering milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered."
243,Ishmael,"""Ishmael"" is the story of a man who finds himself in a room with a gorilla. The gorilla, calling himself Ishmael, can communicate telepathically with the man. The novel continues from this point mainly as a Socratic dialogue between Ishmaal and his new student. ""There's nothing fundamentally wrong with people. Man doesn't know how to live and never will because that knowledge is unobtainable,"" the gorilla says to the man, who is the main character in the novel. ""To enact is to strive to make a story come true,"" he says to his student, ""and one day, the world is like that now,"" the author says of the novel's main character, Ishmaels' pupil. ""In short, &#34;you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down competitors or destroy their food or access to food,"" the book's author says. ""You may not wage war or kill each other but you will inevitably follow this law of survival,"" the novel says, ""which appears to be evolutionarily stable for all species (later dubbed the Law of Law of Survival) ""The world is a foe to be conquered, they will conquer it, and inevitably, their foe will lie bleeding to death at their feet, the author writes. ""Ishmah"" goes on to help his student discover that contrary to what the Takers think, there are immutable laws that life is subject to and it is possible to discern them by studying the biological community of the world, he says.

244,David Copperfield,"The story traces the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderston near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England, in 1820, six months after the death of his father. As David grows to adulthood, a variety of characters enter, leave, and re-enter his life. The novel's two most familiar characters are David's sometime mentor, the debt-ridden Micawber, and the devious and fraudulent clerk, Uriah Heep. David marries the beautiful but naïve Dora Spenlow, who dies after failing to recover from a miscarriage early in their marriage. David then searches his soul and marries Agnes, who had always loved him and with whom he finds true happiness. David and Agnes then have three children, including a daughter named after his aunt Betsey Trotwood. Dan Peggotty safely transports Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by Gummidge and the Micawbers. All eventually find security and happiness in their adopted country. The major characters eventually get some measure of what they deserve, and few narrative threads are left hanging. David's romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, seduces and dishonours Little Em'ly, precipitating the novel's greatest tragedy, and his landlord's daughter Agnes Wickfield, becomes his confidante. David is given good reason to dislike his stepfather and has similar feelings for Murdstone's sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards.

He walks from London to Dover, where he finds his only relative, his unmarried, eccentric auntBetseyTrotwood, who agrees to raise him. She renames him ""Trotwood Copperfield"" and addresses him as 'Trot', and it becomes one of several names to which David answers in the course of the novel. Micawer is painted sympathetically even as the narrator deplores his financial ineptitude. He remains in debtor's prison (the King's Bench Prison) and remains there for several months before being released and moving to Plymouth."
245,Childhood's End,"The novel is divided into three parts, following a third-person omniscient narrative with no main character. In the late 20th century, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are competing to launch the first spaceship into orbit, to military ends. After one week, the aliens announce they are assuming supervision of international affairs to prevent humanity's extinction. As the Overlords, they bring peace, and they claim that interference will be limited. They interfere only twice with human affairs: in South Africa, where sometime before their arrival Apartheid had collapsed and was replaced with savage persecution of the white minority; and in Spain, where they put an end to bull fighting. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. When Jan returns to Earth approximately 80 years later by Earth time, he finds an unexpectedly altered planet. Humanity has effectively become extinct, and hundreds of millions of children – no longer fitting as ""human"" – remain on the quarantined continent. Barely moving, with eyes closed and communicating by telepathy, they are the penultimate form of human evolution. Some Overlords remain on Earth to study the children from a safe distance, but it becomes too dangerous to remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay and transmits a report of what he sees to the Overlord's mind, so he sees the end of Earth's end with them as he sees it. Some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. These groups establish ""New Athens,"" an island colony devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. They are strangely unable to join the Overmind, but serve it as a bridge species, charged with fostering other races' eventual merger with it. They have been watching them since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean. The New Athens is destroyed by its members with a nuclear bomb. Some humans are suspicious of the Over Lords' benign intent, as they never appear in physical form. Although humanity and the overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human culture is become stagnant."
246,The Little Prince,"The story is about a little prince who lives on an asteroid. He falls in love with a rose, but she lies to him, and he grows lonely. He visits six other asteroids, each of which is inhabited by a foolish adult. The prince visits the Earth, and meets a snake that claims to have the power to return him to his home planet, though the prince refuses this offer. The story ends with a portrait of the landscape where the prince and the narrator met and where the snake took the prince's life. The narrator makes a plea that anyone encountering a strange child in that area who refuses to answer questions should contact the narrator immediately. The reader is introduced to the narrator who, as a young boy, drew a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. He is discouraged from drawing when all adults who look at his picture see a hat, instead. As such, he decides to become a pilot, which eventually leads to a crash in the Sahara desert. In the desert, the narrator meets the little prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. To the narrator's surprise, the prince recognizes the drawing for what it is. After a few failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the Narrator draws a box in his frustration, claims that the box holds a sheep inside, and the prince is delighted with the result. The Prince later finds the narrator discussing his return home with the snake, and states that if it looks as though he has died, it will because his body is too heavy to take with him. The next morning, the narrator tries to look for the prince, but is unable to find him, as he is too sad to leave him without making a sound and falling without making his body make a sound. The Narrator then finds the prince in the desert with a well with the help of the prince. Back in the present, theNarrator is dying of thirst, but finds a well to find a well. He then finds a prince who tells him about his product, a pill which eliminates thirst and is very popular, saving people fifty-three minutes a week. He replies that he would use the time to walk and find fresh water. Back to the page you came from. Click here to read the rest of the story.

Which is how it should be. 'Cause after all, lad, if ye love someone deeply, anythin' is possible.""

250,Akallabêth,"Akallabêth (The Downfallen in Adûnaic; Quenya is Atalantë) is the story of the destruction of the Kingdom of Númenor, written by Elendil. After the downfall of the Dark Lord Morgoth at the end of the First Age (which is described in the Quenta Silmarillion), those Men who had aided the Elves in their war against Melkor were given a new small continent of their own, free from the evil and sadness of Middle-earth. But as time went on, Men became evil and rebelled against the Valar and the Elves, over the course of one and a half thousand years, desiring immortality. Tar-Palantir, the penultimate King, repented of the evil of his fathers, but it was too late. The world that had been flat was now spherical, and Aman was only open to Elves, who could still find the Straight Road. The sadness and the shock from the loss of a whole continent lived in the hearts of kings for ever after. The story was made into a film, directed by J.R. R.

252,The Gunslinger,"The main story takes place in a world that is somewhat similar to the Old West but exists in an alternate time frame or parallel universe to ours. Roland exists in a place where ""the world has moved on."" This world has a few things in common with our own, however, including memories of the song ""Hey Jude"" and the child's rhyme that begins ""Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit"". Vestiges of forgotten or skewed versions of real-world technology also appear, such as a reference to a gas pump that is worshipped as a god named ""Amoco"" and an abandoned way station with a water pump which is powered by an ""atomic slug"" As Roland travels across the desert with his mule in search of the man in black, he encounters Brown, a farmer, and Zoltan, his crow, who graciously offers to put him up for the night. While he is there, we learn of his time spent in Tull through a flashback. Tull was a small town which Roland came to not too long before the start of the novel. The Man in Black had passed through the town previously; he brought a dead man back to life, and left a trap for Roland: the town itself. In order to escape with his life, Roland is forced to kill every resident of the town, including his lover, Allie. After Roland returns, Jake discards the jawbone. As Jake and Roland make their way closer to the mountain, Jake begins to fear what will become of him. Roland rescues Jake from an encounter with an oracle, and then couples with the oracle himself in order to learn more about his fate and path to the Dark Tower. Roland chooses to follow Jake, and as Jake dangles precariously from the edge of the tracks, Roland makes a pivotal choice; save Jake or pursue the Man In Black. After Jake tells Roland: ""Go then there are other worlds than these other worlds,"" Roland lets go of the edge and falls without screaming. The man in Black states that he is merely a pawn of Roland's true enemy, and that he now controls the Tower itself, as the center of everything. Roland makes his way down to speak to the man In Black, who reads Roland's fate from a pack of cards, including ""the sailor"" (Eddie Dean) ""the lady of shadows"" ""the prisoner"" (Odetta Holmes) ""The Dark Tower"" is Roland's ultimate destination."

King includes part of a rough draft and an edited draft of his own story entitled ""1408"" in the UK paperback version. He describes it as a guide for how ""a competent writer can become a good one"" King also uses quotes from other books and authors to illustrate his points. This includes his beliefs that a writer should edit out unnecessary details and avoid the use of unnecessary adverbs.

254,The Body,"Gordie, Chris, Teddy, and Vern Tessio are four friends who go on a camping trip to Back Harlow Road in 1960. They find the body of Ray Brower, a boy who went missing while picking blueberries. The four friends decide that they will find it so as to be famous. When they finally find the spot where the body lies, a gang of bullies arrives just after they do. The older boys are upset to see the four friends, and during an argument, Chris pulls a gun belonging to his father from his bag back, that he took from his home and fires into the air and then threatens Ace, the leader of the gang. After a brief standoff Ace realizes that Chris is serious, and the teenagers leave. Having seen the body, the boys realize that there is nothing else to be done with it, and return home without further incident. The boys refuse to identify their assailants to the authorities, and there are no further repercussions. The final two chapters describe the fate of Gordie's three friends, none of whom survive past young adulthood. Vern is killed in a house fire after a party. Teddy, while under the influence of alcohol and drugs, crashes his car and he and his passengers are killed. Chris, who became an outstanding high school and college student and was in his second year of law school, is stabbed to death after trying to stop an argument in a fast-food restaurant. Gordon, the only survivor, continues to write stories through college, and publishes a number of them in small literary journals and men's magazines. His first novel becomes a best-seller, and a successful film. At the time of writing about the events in 1960, he has written seven novels about the supernatural. Gordon is also revealed to be a veteran of the Vietnam War and the counter-culture of the 1960s, occasionally referred to in the main story. Another story from Different Seasons, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption is referenced in this story. The King's Carrie, which takes place over ten years later but was written eight years earlier, features a character who is not the same person as the Teddy and Vern from the novel. The novel Cujo is referenced when Gordie compares the dog Chopper to Cujo, which is set twenty years later in Cujo's short story ""Constable Bannerman"" A ""Nona Tessio"" short story appears later in The Dead Zone and a short story in ""The Dead Zone"""
255,Wizard and Glass,"The novel begins where The Waste Lands ended. The Kansas City baseball team is the Monarchs (as opposed to the Royals), and Nozz-A-La is a popular soft drink. Links between these books also include the following reference to The Walkin' Dude from The Stand on page 95, ""Someone had spray-painted over both signs marking the ramp's ascending curve. On the one reading St. Louis 215, someone had slashed watch out for the walking dude.""(King, 2003, pg 95) among others. The Wizard of Oz parallels continue inside, where the Wizard is revealed to be Randall Flagg, also known as Marten Broadcloak, who flees when Roland attempts to kill him with his own guns. In his old place he leaves the ka-tet, which shows the day Roland accidentally killed his own mother, which Roland, it has been explained time and again, tends to be very bad medicine for his friends and loved ones.

256,The Waste Lands,"Roland, Susannah, and Eddie have moved east from the shore of the Western Sea, and into the woods of Out-World. They discover one of the six mystical Beams that hold the world together. Roland reveals to his ka-tet that his mind has become divided by the paradox of having let Jake Chambers die under the mountain after finding him at the Way Station in the desert. Meanwhile, in 1977 New York, Jake Chambers is experiencing exactly the same crippling mental divide, which is causing alarm at his private school. Roland burns Walter's jawbone and the key to his and Jake's dilemma is revealed—but to Eddie Dean, not Roland. Eddie must carve a key that will open the door to New York in 1977. Jake is able to pass into Roland's world using a key to open a door in an abandoned haunted house on Dutch Hill in his place and time. This portal ends in a'speaking ring' in Roland'sworld. The novel ends with Blaine and Roland's ka-Tet speeding through the Waste Lands, a radioactive land of mutated animals and ancient ruins created by something that is claimed to have been far worse than a nuclear war, on the way to Topeka -the end of the line. The three gunslingers follow the Path of the Beam inland to Mid-World and are reunited at the Cradle of Lud, a train station which houses a monorail that the travelers use to escape Lud before its final destruction brought about by the monorails's artificial intelligence known as Blaine the Mono. Later the drums are revealed as ""War Drums"" which Lud's citizens fight to. Once aboard Blaine, a highly intelligent, computerized train which is insane due to system degradation, it announces its intention to derail itself with them aboard unless they can defeat it in a riddle contest. Roland and Oy must then trace them through a man-made labyrinth in the city and then into the sewers in order to rescue the boy from Gasher and his leader, the Tick-Tock Man. The ancient, high-tech city has been ravaged by decades of war, and one of their surviving fighters, Gasher, kidnaps Jake by taking advantage of the near-accident the team faced while crossing a decaying bridge that looks like the George Washington Bridge of NYC. The team must then rescue Jake from gasher and leave Gasher for dead. The book ends with Susannah having sex with the demon of the speaking ring to keep it from attacking Eddie."

Dolores's ""confession"" develops into the story of her life, her troubled marriage, and her relationship with her employer. Unlike many other works by King, there is little focus on the supernatural; the only such event in the book are two telepathic visions, which form a link to King's novel Gerald's Game. Although reviewer Sean Piccoli observed the novel otherwise contained ""vintage bone-yard King: the tiny town, the secret lives.

260,Gerald's Game,"The story begins with Jessie Burlingame and her husband Gerald in the bedroom of their secluded cabin in western Maine. Gerald, a successful lawyer with an aggressive personality, has been able to reinvigorate the couple's sex life by handcuffing Jessie to the bed. As Gerald starts to crawl on top of her, knowing her protests are real but ignoring them anyway, she kicks him in the stomach and in the groin, and he then has a heart attack, falls from the bed to the floor, cracks his head, and dies. Jessie is alone in the cabin and unable to move or summon help. The only things that show up are a hungry stray dog named Prince that starts feeding on Gerald's body and a terrifying, deformed apparition that may or may not be real. Jessie begins to think of this bizarre visitor as ""The Space Cowboy"" (after a line from a Steve Miller song, ""The Joker""). A combination of panic and thirst eventually causes Jessie to hallucinate. She hears voices in her head, each one ostensibly the voice of a person in her life. These voices represent different parts of her personality which help her extract a painful childhood memory she has kept suppressed for many years. She was sexually abused by her father at age ten during a solar eclipse that occurred in her Maine hometown. She also begins to realize how unhappy her marriage was, and that she sacrificed the life she wanted for the security of Gerald's paycheck by being a trophy wife without children. Jessie escapes the handcuffs by slicing her arm open all the way around on a broken glass and giving herself a degloving injury in order to lubricate her skin enough for the cuffs, which were made for men and not women and thus almost loose enough for her to slip out normally, to slide off her right hand. She is then able to move behind the bed, push it over to the bureau and use one of the keys to unlock her left handcuff. When she awakens, it is now nighttime, and the Space Cowboy has made his way back into the house. Jessie confronts him and throws her wedding ring at his box of jewelry and bones, thinking that is what he wanted all along, then turns and runs out of the house, but is terrified to discover the Space cowboy sitting in the backseat of the car. The story cuts to months later with Jessie recuperating from the incident and being looked after by a nurse. At the end, we get to read the letter that Jessie writes to Ruth Neary, detailing what happened after the incident."
261,The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon: A Novel,"The story is set in motion by a family hiking trip, during which Trisha's brother, Pete, and mother constantly squabble about the mother's divorce with her father. Trisha falls back to avoid listening and is therefore unable to find her family again after she wanders off the trail to take a bathroom break. Trying to catch up by attempting a shortcut, she slips and falls down a steep embankment and ends up hopelessly lost. Eventually, a combination of fear, hunger, and thirst causes Trisha to hallucinate. She imagines several people from her life, as well as her hero, Tom Gordon, appearing to her. Her trial becomes a test of a 9-year-old girl's ability to maintain sanity in the face of seemingly certain death. Racked with pneumonia and near death, she comes upon a road, but just as she discovers signs of civilization, she is confronted by a bear, which she interprets as the God of the Lost in disguise. Facing down her fear, she realizes it is the bottom of the ninth, and she must close the game. She takes a pitcher's stance and throws her Walkman like a baseball, hitting the bear in theFace, and startling it enough to make it back away. A hunter who has come upon the confrontation between girl and beast frightens the bear away and takes Trisha away. She wakes up in a hospital tofind her divorced parents and older brother waiting near her bedside. A nurse tells the girl's family that they must leave because ""Her numbers are up and we don't want that"" Her father is the last to leave. Before he does Trisha asks him to hand her her Red Sox hat (autographed by Tom Gordon) and she points towards the sky, just as Tom Gordon does when he closes a game. Before she does, she points to the sky and she says, ""I love you, Tom"" Trisha knows that she earned her rescue. She is left with a bottle of water, two Twinkies, a boiled egg, a tuna sandwich, a poncho, a Game Boy, and a Walkman. It is left unclear whether increasingly obvious signs of supernatural events in the woods are also hallucinations. The girl decides to follow a creek because of what she read in Little House on the Prairie (though it soon turns into a swamp-like river), rationalizing that all bodies of water lead eventually to civilization. As the cops stop searching for the night, she huddles up underneath a tree to rest."
262,The Green Mile,"A first-person narrative told by Paul Edgecombe, the novel switches between Paul as an old man in the Georgia Pines nursing home sharing his story with fellow resident Elaine Connelly in 1996, and his time in 1932 as the block supervisor of the Cold Mountain Penitentiary death row. This year marks the arrival of John Coffey, a 6'8"" powerfully built black man who has been convicted of raping and murdering two small white girls. During his time on the Mile, John interacts with fellow prisoners Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix, a Cajun arsonist, rapist, and murderer, and William Wharton (""Billy the Kid"" to himself, ""Wild Bill"" to the guards), a wild-acting and dangerous multiple murderer who is determined to make as much trouble as he can before he is executed. Other inhabitants include Arlen Bitterbuck, a Native American convicted of killing a man in a fight over a pair of boots; Arthur Flanders, a real estate executive who killed his father to perpetrate insurance fraud, and whose sentence is eventually commuted to life imprisonment. Paul and the other guards are antagonized throughout the book by Percy Wetmore, a sadistic guard who enjoys irritating the prisoners. Paul is unsure how to help John, but John tells him not to worry, as he is ready to die anyway, wanting to escape the cruelty of the world. John's execution is the last one in which Paul participates. He introduces Mr. Jingles to Elaine just before the mouse dies, having lived 64 years past these events, and explains that those healed by John gained an unnaturally long lifespan. Elaine dies shortly after, never learning how Paul's wife died in his arms immediately after they suffered a bus accident, and that he then saw John's ghost watching him from an overpass.

263,The Long Walk,"One hundred teenage boys participate in an annual walking contest called ""The Long Walk"", which is the ""national sport"" Each Walker must maintain a speed of at least four miles per hour; if he drops below that speed for 30 seconds, he receives a verbal warning. If a Walker with three warnings slows down again, he is ""ticketed"". The meaning of this term is intentionally kept vague at first, but it soon becomes clear that ""buying a ticket"" means to be shot dead by soldiers riding in half-tracks along the roadside. Walkers may be shot immediately for certain serious violations, such as trying to leave the road or attacking the half-track. There are no stops, rest periods, or established finish line, and the Walk does not pause for any reason (including bad weather or darkness); it ends only when one Walker is left alive. The winner receives ""The Prize"": anything he wants for the rest of his life. It is implied that many past winners have died soon after the Walk, due to its hazardous mental and physical challenges. The story has several characters who suffer mental breakdown, one of whom kills himself by tearing out his throat, and most characters experience some mental degeneration from the stress and lack of sleep. The protagonist of the novel is Raymond Davis Garraty, a 16-year-old boy from the town of Pownal in Androscoggin County, Maine. Early on, Ray falls in with several other boys—including Peter McVries, Arthur Baker, Hank Olson, Collie Parker, Pearson, Harkness, and Abraham—who refer to themselves as ""The Musketeers"". Another Walker—Gary Barkovitch—quickly establishes himself as an external antagonist, as he quickly angers his fellow walkers with multiple taunts of ""dancing on their graves"". This results in the death of a fellow walker, Rank, who is ticketed while trying to injure Barkovitches. The only character Stebbins truly interacts with is Ray GarratY. Throughout the Walk,. StebBins establishes himself. as a loner, observing the ground beneath him as he listens to fellow Walkers' complaints, seemingly unaffected by the mental andphysical strains. They may request a fresh canteen at any time, and new food supplies are distributed at 9:00 every morning. According to the rules, the Walkers can obtain aid only from the soldiers, who distribute canteens of water and belts packed with food concentrates just before the Walk begins. They are allowed to have bodily contact with onlookers as long as they stay on the road."
264,Solaris,"Solaris chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life on a far-distant planet. Kris Kelvin arrives aboard the scientific research station hovering (via anti-gravity generators) near the oceanic surface of the planet Solaris. The ocean’s intelligence expresses physical phenomena in ways difficult for their limited earth science to explain, deeply upsetting the scientists. The alien (extraterrestrial) mind of Solaris is so greatly different from the human mind of (objective) consciousness that attempts at inter-species communications are a dismal failure. It does this via the materialization of physical human simulacra; Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide. The torments of the other researchers are only alluded to but seem even worse than Kelvin's personal purgatory. It ends with the discovery of a planet-encompassing organism that is revealed to be the equivalent of muscle contractions on the surface of a distant planet. It is the first of a series of books about the planet, Solaris, to be published by Simon & Schuster, which will be followed by a second series in 2015 and a third in 2016. It will be available on Blu-ray, DVD, and Blu-Ray in the spring and summer of 2015, and on DVD in the summer of 2016.

265,You Can't Take It with You,"The story takes place entirely in the large house of a slightly batty New York City family. Various characters in the lives of the Vanderhof/Sycamore/Carmichael clan are introduced in the first act. The patriarch of the family, Grandpa Vanderhof, is an eccentric old man who keeps snakes and has never paid his income tax. In the end, Mr. Kirby is converted to the happy madness of the Sycamores after he happens in during a visit by the ex-Grand Duchess of Russia, Olga Katrina, who is currently earning her living as a waitress. ""If they are mad, then the rest of the world is madder,"" says the play's author, ""but it is not long before you realize that if they aremad, then they are not mad"" The play ends with a toast to Tony and Alice, and it is revealed that they love each other very, very much, though it is unclear whether a marriage of their families could ever work out as well as they would like it to.

The battle goes to a sea-fight, until Antony resolves to kill the Egyptian queen again, so that he can kill her for betraying him in the first place. In the middle of the Battle of Actium,Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his army to ruin. Rather than go over to his side, Antony goes over to the enemy's side and kills Octavius. He then returns to Alexandria, Egypt, and crowns himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Empire. He accuses Octavia of not giving him his fair share of Pompey's lands, and is angry that LepidUS is out of the triumvirate. He also reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying ""Give me a kiss; even this repays me."" In a famous passage, he delineates Cleopasia's charms in paradoxical terms (rhetorical antithesis) ""Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies."" A soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavan. AntONY prepares to battle OctavIAN. On the eve of the battle, Antoney's soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god Hercules abandoning protection of Antony. Antoney refuses, since Octavion has dared him to fight at sea. However, in the end Antony loses the battle and his fleet surrenders and flee – his own fleet, and he loses his own treachery, so he denounces Cleopraitra and denounces her for treachery. He dies from a broken heart that he dies in the battle."
267,The Day of the Triffids,"Bill Masen is a man who has made his living working with ""triffids"" Triffids are tall plants capable of aggressive and seemingly intelligent behaviour. They are able to move about by ""walking"" on their roots, appear to communicate with each other, and possess a deadly whip-like poisonous sting that enables them to kill and feed on the rotting carcasses of their victims. Masen has developed a theory that they were bioengineered in the USSR and then accidentally released into the wild when a plane smuggling their seeds was shot down. The result is worldwide cultivation of triffids. After unbandaging his eyes, he wanders through an anarchic London full of almost entirely blind inhabitants, and witnesses civilization collapsing around him. He meets a sighted woman, wealthy novelist Josella Playton, who was being forcibly used as a guide by a violent blind man. She and Masen begin to fall in love and decide to leave London. They attempt to make the Sussex farm into a largely self-sufficient colony, with reasonable success. Years pass, during which it becomes steadily harder both to keep out the encroaching plants - at least two triffid break-ins are recorded in the novel - and to continue fetching essential supplies (such as oil) from the decaying cities. One day a helicopter pilot lands at the farm and reports that the group has established a successful colony on the Isle of Wight. Despite their struggles, the Masens are reluctant to leave their home but are forced to. Despite the fact that many more blind people have survived to join them, Masens' hand is forced to move to another enclave under the general agreement of a despotic government. The novel ends with the arrival of a squad of soldiers who represent a new government setting up feudal enclaves across the country, which is setting up a new despotic regime. The protagonist recognizes the leader, Torrence, as the redheaded man from London who is the leader of the government's redheaded faction. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced at £16.99 (with a p&p of £12.99). The novel is available in hardback, paperback, hardback and Kindle editions.

268,Antigone,"Antigone and Ismene are the sisters of the dead Polyneices and Eteocles. Antigone wants to bury her brother herself, in defiance of Creon's edict. Creon orders that the two women be temporarily imprisoned. The Chorus of Elders pledges their support and Creon agrees to bury them. Haemon's mother Eurydice kills herself and Haemon stabs himself after finding the body of her husband. The play ends with the Chorus singing a choral ode to Dionysus, the god of wine and of the theater, and then a Messenger enters to tell them that Haemon has killed himself. The Messenger asks Creon to tell his wife and mother-in-law that everything has happened, and that he is still valued so much he has still protected his servants. He understands that his own actions have caused these events, and asks his wife to tell him that he has been so much valued and he has so much more to offer her than he ever thought he would be able to. The wife tells him that she will never forgive him for what he has done to her husband, and he leaves her to die in a cave with her husband's body in the middle of the night. He then returns to the palace to bury the bodies of the two sisters, and the play is over. He returns to Thebes after a short absence, bringing Antig one with him. He asks the Messenger to tell her to tell Creon that Haemonic has killed herself, and she says she will do it. He leaves with a retinue of men to help him right his previous mistakes. He goes back to the Palace to bury AntigOne and the Ch chorus sings about honouring the gods, but after he returns, he returns with the girl and says that he will bury her alive in the earth. He says that the gods are displeased, refusing to accept any sacrifices or prayers from Thebes. Tiresias, the blind prophet, enters. He warns Creon. All of Greece will despise him and the sacrificial offerings of Thebes will not be accepted by the gods. He tells Creon he will lose ""a son of [his] own loins"" for the crimes of leaving Polyneice unburied and putting Antigon into the earth (he does not say that Antig1 should not be condemned to death, only that it is improper to keep a living body underneath the earth)"

273,King John,"King John receives an ambassador from France, who demands, on pain of war, that he renounce his throne in favour of his nephew, Arthur. The French King, Philip, believes to be the rightful heir to the throne. In France, King Philip and his forces besiege the English-ruled town of Angiers, threatening attack unless its citizens support Arthur. Philip is supported by Austria, who is believed to have killed King Richard. The Bastard plans the final assault on Louis' forces, until he is told that Pandolf has arrived with a peace treaty. The English nobles swear allegiance to John's son Prince Henry, and the Bastard reflects that this episode has taught that internalickering could be as perilous to England's fortunes as foreign invasion. John is poisoned by a disgruntled monk. His nobles gather around him as he dies. Queen Eleanor is left in charge of English possessions in France, while the Bastard is sent to collect funds from English monasteries. John orders Hubert to kill Arthur. Hubert has a furious argument with John, during which he reveals that Arthur is still alive. John, delighted, sends him to report the news to the nobles. Arthur dies jumping from a castle wall. The nobles believe he was murdered by John, and refuse to believe Hubert's entreaties. Many English nobles return to John’s side after a dying French nobleman, Melun, warns them that Louis plans to kill them after his victory. John agrees to make a deal with Pandolf, swearing allegiance to the Pope in exchange for Pandolf's negotiating with the French on his behalf. Pandolf suggests to Louis that he now has as strong a claim to the English throne as Arthur (and indeed John), and Louis agrees to invade England. War breaks out; Austria is beheaded by the Bastard in revenge for his father's death; and both Angiers and Arthur are captured by the English. John knights the Bastard under the name Richard. John's nobles urge Arthur's release, but are wrong-footed by Hubert’S announcement that Arthur was dead. The nobility, believing he was Murdered, defect to Louis' side. John refuses to recant, whereupon he is excommunicated. Cardinal Pandolf arrives from Rome bearing a formal accusation that John has disobeyed the pope and appointed an archbishop contrary to his desires. John swears allegiance to Louis, but Pandolf brings him round by pointing out that his links to the church are older and firmer. Louis and Blanche are married."
274,Love's Labour's Lost,"The play opens with the King of Navarre and three noble companions, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville, taking an oath to devote themselves to three years of study. The main story is assisted by many other humorous sub-plots. A rather heavily-accented Spanish swordsman, Don Adriano de Armado, tries and fails to woo a country wench, Jaquenetta, helped by Moth, his page, and rivalled by Costard, a country idiot. We are also introduced to two scholars, Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel, and we see them converse with each other in schoolboy Latin. In the final act, the comic characters perform a play to entertain the nobles, an idea conceived by Hol ofernes, where they represent the Nine Worthies. At the end of this 'play' within the play, there is a bitter twist in the story. News arrives that the Princess's father has died and she must leave to take the throne. The ladies, unconvinced that their love is that strong, claim that the men must wait a whole year and a day to prove what they say is true. This is an unusual ending for Shakespeare and Elizabethan comedy. A play mentioned by Francis Meres, Love's Labour's Won, is believed by some to be a sequel to this play. The King and his nobles swear to remain faithful to their ladies, but the ladies claim that they must wait one year and one day. The four Lords – as well as the Ladies' courtier Boyet – mock the play and Armado and Costard almost come to blows. The play ends with the ladies saying that they will not leave the kingdom until they have proved their love to the King for a year. The men agree to this, and the ladies leave in the next day. It is a strange ending for a Shakespeare play, but it is not unusual for a play of this type to end with this kind of twist. It was written by William Shakespeare in the 16th century, and is one of his most famous works, along with The Winter's Tale and A Midsummer's Night's Dream.

This angers the nobility, who accuse Richard of wasting England's money. Richard is taken into prison to the castle of Pomfret. An ambitious nobleman (Exton) goes to the prison and murders the former king. King Henry repudiates the murderer and vows to journey to Jerusalem to cleanse himself of his part in Richard's death.

279,The State of the Art,"At 100 pages long, the title novella makes up the bulk of the book. chronicles a Culture mission to Earth in the late Seventies. It also serves as a prequel of sorts to Use of Weapons by featuring one of that novel's characters, Diziet Sma. Here, Sma argues for contact with Earth, to try to fix the mess the human species has made of it. Another Culture citizen, Linter, goes native, choosing to renounce his Culture body enhancements so as to be more like the locals. Li, who is a Star Trek fan, argues that the whole 'incontestably neurotic and clinically insane species' should be eradicated with a micro black hole. The ship Arbitrary has ideas, and a sense of humour, of its own. 'Also while I'd been away, the ship had sent a request on a postcard to the BBC's World Service, asking for 'Mr David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" for the good ship arbitrary and all who sail in her.' It didn't get the request played, but the ship thought this was hilarious.' The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99. It is available in hardback, paperback and e-book.

280,The Player of Games,"Jernau Morat Gurgeh, a famously skilful player of board games and other similar contests, lives on Chiark Orbital, and is bored with his successful life. The Culture's Special Circumstances inquires about his willingness to participate in a long journey, though won't explain further unless he agrees to participate. One of his drone friends, Mawhrin-Skel, convinces him to cheat in one of his matches in an attempt to win in an unprecedented perfect fashion. He accepts the offer and spends the next two years travelling to the Empire of Azad in the Small Magellanic Cloud, where a complex game is used to determine social rank and political status. By the time he arrives, he has grasped the game but is unsure how he will measure up against opponents who have been studying it for their entire lives. As he advances through the tournament he is matched against increasingly powerful Azad politicians, and ultimately the Emperor himself in the final round. Faced with defeat, the Emperor attempts to kill GurgeH, but is himself killed by a shot from his own weapon, deflected by Flere-Imsaho (who later refuses to tell the reader if it was coincidental) It is ultimately revealed to the reader that Flere/Imsho was the same drone as Mawhr in Skel, who was also the narrator of the novel itself. The player's participation was part of a Culture plot to overthrow the corrupt and savage Empire from within, and that he, the player, was in fact a pawn in a much larger game. As a Culture citizen, he naturally plays with a style markedly different from his opponents, many of whom stack the odds against him one way or another, such as forming backroom agreements to cooperate against him (which is allowed by the game's rules). As he progresses through the tournaments he is match against increasingly power-hungry Azad officials, including the Emperor, who is ultimately killed by his own own weapon. The game itself is sufficiently subtle and complex that a player's tactics reflect his own political and philosophical outlook, and it is revealed that the player's style is very different from those of his opponents. It is also revealed that a drone who was ejected from Special Circumsstances due to its unstable personality, had been also ejected due to it's unstable personality. The drone who had been ejected was later admitted back into the club as well as the narrator, who later reveals that the drone had been the same one as the player."
281,Excession,"The Excession of the title is a perfect black-body sphere that appears mysteriously on the edge of Culture space. It appears to be older than the Universe itself and resists attempts of the Culture and technologically equivalent societies (notably the Zetetic Elench) to probe it. The Excession is what the Culture's social scientists describe as an Outside Context Problem, one which a society cannot foresee and is often fatal. The GSV Sleeper Service eventually takes control of the situation. Its name is the most meaningful pun in the story: outwardly it is an Eccentric (drop-out from the Culture) which dedicates its enormous resources to presenting tableaux of historical events (mainly battles) populated by passengers in suspended animation. But in fact it is a sleeping member of Special Circumstances, the culture's covert operations organization. It prepares to deploy this fleet during transit to the Excession. But it has an unresolved issue. Until a few decades previously, the ship operated under another name as a normal GSV, providing a habitat for a vast number of Culture citizens. Two of its passengers, Dajeil and Genar-Hofoen, had had an intense love-affair which ended badly. DajEil froze her pregnancy and subsequently remained in a state of intense depression for 40 years, and the ship changed its name to Sleeper service. It carried only one conscious humanoid passenger, and spent much of its attention trying to talk her out of her depression, for which it considered itself partly responsible. As a result, when the Culture asks Sleeper. Service to help in dealing with the threat of war, it demands that in return Genar. Hofoen must be handed over to it. It then unloads the passengers who had been part of its historical tableaux into engines, and easily outruns the very fast ship which other elements of the culture had asked to keep watch on it. When it arrives it becomes apparent it has previously converted the rest of its spare mass into a vast fleet of remote-controlled warships numbering in the area of 80, and in response to the Sleeper charging at it, triggers a multi-year Grid-light wave which threatens to obliterate its entire fleet. Only its Mindstate, transmitted at right at the right time by the accompanying Grey Area, saves it. At the same time war is averted. A prolonged conspiracy led the Culture to commit suicide which led the culture and the Affront to commit a prolonged conspiracy."
282,Look to Windward,"Major Quilan is offered the chance to avenge the lost Chelgrians who died in a civil war and is inducted into a plot to strike back at the Culture. As part of the plot, his ""soulkeeper"" is equipped with both the mind of a long-dead Chelgrian general and a device that can transport wormholes connected to weapons caches. Quilan succeeds in placing the wormholes in the Mind's Hub, but the Mind detects them immediately and suggests that the Involved ""aliens"" assisting Quilan's mission may have been a group of Culture minds seeking to keep the Culture from being too complacent. Having struggled with its memories from the Idiran-Culture war, the Mind reveals to Quilan that it seeks to cease existing and offers to take Quilan with it. They both die. It is not revealed whether this was a form of retribution by the Culture or a cover-up by a secret Culture faction. In the end of the novel, a nightmarishly efficient E-Dust Assassin is unleashed against the Chelgian priest who was responsible, as well as his immediate co-conspirators. It was the General Systems Vehicle Lasting Damage, when it was known as the General System. Lasting damage, was the cause of the civil war that resulted from the Culture's interference in Chelgians' politics. The novel was released on September 25, 2013.

283,Use of Weapons,"The book is made up of two narrative streams, interwoven in alternating chapters. The numbers of the chapters indicate which stream they belong to: one stream is numbered forward in words (One, Two...), while the other is numbered in reverse with Roman numerals (XIII, XII...) The story told by the former moves forward chronologically and tells a self-contained story, while in the latter is written in reverse chronology with each chapter successively earlier in Zakalwe's life. Further complicating this structure is a prologue and epilogue set shortly after the events of the main narrative, and many flashbacks within the chapters. It transpires that the payment he requires from Diziet Sma relates to an incident from his earlier life. The backward-moving stream describes earlier ""jobs"" he has performed for the Culture, ultimately returning to his pre-Culture career as a general on his homeworld. The forward-moving part of the novel deals with the attempts of Sma and a drone named Skaffen-Amtiskaw to re-enlist Zakal We for another ""job"" The task itself and the payment that ZakalWe wishes for it. It is ultimately revealed that the task itself relates to a previous incident from the Culture's history. The story is told in two parts: the first in words, and the second in reverse numerals. The book is published by Simon & Schuster at £16.99 (hardback) and £20 ( paperback) in the U.S. and £25 ( paperback and hardback) respectively. It was released in the UK in May 2013. It has been described as a ""masterpiece of science fiction"" and has been praised by critics as ""incredible"" and ""a masterpiece of science-fiction writing"" It has also been called ""the best book of the 21st century"" by The New York Review of Books. The author has also spoken of his desire to write a sequel to the novel, which is due to be released later this year. The novel is available for pre-order on Amazon.com for £12.99 ($14.99) with the option to buy the book in hardback for £15.99 (£16.95) and the option in paperback for £14.95 (£15.95). The book has been published in Australia and New Zealand, with a UK release date of September 2013. The U.K. release date for the book is September 2014."
284,"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish","Arthur Dent has hitch-hiked through the galaxy and is dropped off on a planet in a rainstorm. He realises that he appears to be in England on Earth, even though he saw it destroyed by the Vogons. He manages to hitch a ride with a man named Russell, who is driving home his sister Fenchurch (Fenny for short) Russell explains that she had become delusional after worldwide mass hysteria over the ""hallucinations with the big yellow spaceships"" (Vogon Ships) Arthur becomes curious about Fenchurch, but they reach his home before he can ask more questions. Inside his still-standing home, Arthur finds a gift-wrapped bowl inscribed with the words ""So Long and Thanks..."" which he then uses for his Babel Fish. Arthur considers that Fenchurch is somehow connected to him and to the Earth's destruction, and finds that he still has the ability to fly whenever he lets his thoughts wander. He catches her hitchhiking and he learns more about her. He finds her home when he locates the cave he had lived in after crashing onto prehistoric Earth with the Golgafrinchans. As they talk they find more circumstances connecting them. They learn from the bowl's audio message that the dolphins, aware of the Vogon, left Earth for an alternate dimension but not before replacing the destroyed Earth with a new version and transporting everything to it as a way of saving humans. Arthur takes Fenchurch to the planet where God's Final Message to His Creation is written, and they happen across Marvin, who, because of previous events, is now approximately 37 times older than the known age of the universe and is barely able to continue. Marvin, with Arthur and Fenchurch's help, reads the Message (""We apologise for the inconvenience""), smiles, utters the final words ""I think... I feel good about it,"" and dies happily. Ford Prefect discovers that during an update of the ""Hitchhiker's Guide"", his previous entry for Earth, ""Mostly harmless"", has been replaced with the volumes of text he wrote during his research. Recognising that something is strange, Ford begins to hitchhike across the galaxy to reach Earth, eventually using the ship of a giant robot to land in the centre of London and causing a panic. In the chaos, Ford meets up with Fenchurch and together they commandeer the robot's ship. He obtains her phone number but loses it. The two travel to California to see John Watson, an enigmatic scientist who purports to know the cause of the dolphins' disappearance and who eschewed his original name in favour of ""Wonko the Sane"""
285,Choke,"Choke follows Victor Mancini and his friend Denny through a few months of their lives with frequent flashbacks to the days when Victor was a child. In the present day setting of the book, Victor is now a man in his mid-twenties who left medical school in order to find work to support his feeble mother who is now in a nursing home. He cannot afford the care that his mother is receiving so he resorts to being a con man. He consistently goes to various restaurants and purposely causes himself to choke mid-way through his meal, luring a ""good Samaritan"" into saving his life. He keeps a detailed list of everyone who saves him and sends them frequent letters about fictional bills he is unable to pay. The people feel so sorry for him that they send him cards and letters asking him about how he's doing and even continue to send him money to help him with the bills. He works at a re-enactment museum set in colonial times, where most of the employees are drug-addicts or, in Denny's case, a fellow recovering sex addict. Denny is later fired from the museum, and begins collecting stones from around the city to build his ""dream home;"" Palahniuk based this portion of the novel on the true story of Ferdinand Cheval. Victor first met Denny at a sexual addiction support group (he was there as a guy who masturbates too much), and they later applied together to the same job. Later on, he starts talking to his mother again for the first time in years. The narrative is episodic, and is presented out of chronological order, a style common to the author's books. This and his constant moves from one home to another have left Victor unable to form lasting and stable relationships with women. Victor, as a result, finds himself getting sexual gratification from women on a solely superficial level (using sex anonymous meetings to find many of his sexual partners). While growing up, Victor's mother taught him numerous conspiracy theories and obscure medical facts which both confused and frightened him. He is later able to form a relationship with his mother for first time since he was a young boy, and they begin talking to each other again. The novel is written in a style similar to that of author David Lean, with many of the events occurring in the first few chapters. It is set in New York City in the 1930s and 1940s, and the main character, Victor, is a medical student at the time."

287,In Search of Lost Time,"The novel recounts the experiences of the Narrator while growing up, participating in society, falling in love, and learning about art. The Narrator describes two walking paths: the way past Charles Swann’s home and the Guermantes way, both containing scenes of natural beauty. He discovers how appearances conceal the true nature of things, and tries writing a description of some nearby steeples. At the end of the novel, he dreams of visiting Venice or the Balbec, but he is too unwell and instead takes walks in the Champs-Élysées, where he meets Gilberte and befriends her father, now married to Mme de Norpois. The novel laments the nature of nature and laments that the old sights of the area are long gone, and he laments his parents’ marriage to the diplomat Noris de Noris, a fugitive of the French Revolution, who has gone to live with his wife in the U.S. A sonata by Vinteuil, which features a ‘little phrase,’ becomes the motif for their deepening relationship. The “little phrase” is played and Swann realizes Odette’S love for him is gone. He tortures himself wondering about her true relationships with others, but his love for her, despite renewing his love, gradually diminishes. He moves on and marvels that he ever loved a woman who was not the type of type he had always dreamed of. He is awed by the magic of their name, and is captivated when he first sees MME de Guermante. He describes their servant Françoise, who is uneducated but possesses an earthy wisdom and a strong sense of both duty and tradition. He meets an elegant “lady in pink” while visiting his uncle Adolphe. He learns Swann made an unsuitable marriage but has social ambitions for his beautiful daughter GilberTE. The Verdurins host M. de Forcheville; their guests include Cottard, a doctor; Brichot, an academic; Saniette, the object of scorn; and a painter, M. Biche. One guest is Odette de Crecy, a former courtesan who has met Swann and invites him to the group. Swann grows jealous of Odette, who now keeps him at arm's length, and suspects an affair between her and ForCheville, aided by the Verdurin."
288,Liza of Lambeth,"Liza Kemp is an 18-year-old factory worker and the youngest of 13 children. She is now living alone with her ageing and incompetent mother. She cannot really make up her mind as far as her love life is concerned. She very much likes Tom, a boy her age, but when he proposes to her she rejects him. Nevertheless she is persuaded to join a party of 32 who make a coach trip to a nearby village. On their way back, in the dark, Liza realizes that Jim Blakeston is making a pass at her by holding her hand. After their arrival back home, Jim manages to speak to her alone and to steal a kiss from her. Seemingly without considering either the moral implications or the consequences of her actions,. Liza feels attracted to Jim. They never appear together in public because they do not want the other residents of Vere Street or their workmates to start talking about them. The novel builds up to a sad climax when it gradually turns out that all men—maybe with the exception of Tom—are alike: They invariably beat their wives, especially when they have been drinking. Soon after their wedding Harry beats up Sally just because she has been away from home chatting with a female neighbour of theirs. What is more, he even hits Mrs Cooper, his mother-in-law. Liza's friend Sally gets married, has to stop working at the factory because her husband would not let his wife earn her own money, and soon becomes pregnant. She feels increasingly isolated, with Sally being married now and even Tom seemingly shunning her, but her love for Jim keeps her going. They do talk about their love affair though: about the possibility of Jim leaving his wife and children (""I dunno if I could get on without the kids""), about Liza not being able to leave her mother because the latter needs her help, about living somewhere else ""as if we was married"", about bigamy -- but, strangely, not about adultery. But in the end they do ""slide down into the darkness of the passage"". (The reader never learns whether at that time Liza is still a virgin or not.) Liza has a black eye the following morning because she is frightened of Jim's wife, who is pregnant again, and stops talking to her husband at home—this is her way of opposing his affair with Liza. She tells other people what she would do to Liza if she got hold of her, and the other people tell Liza to ""coward"" to the third person."
289,The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,"The Weirdstone of Brisingamen is a bracelet containing powerful white magic. It was used to seal the caves of Fundindelve, deep inside the hill of Alderley. The stone was stolen centuries before by a farmer whose milk-white mare Cadellin had bought to complete the numbers. Susan's mother passed it on to Susan, who is oblivious as to its history and purpose. Susan finally realizes the identity of the Weirdstone, and fearing its destruction, sets out to warn the wizard. The children set out to reclaim the stone on their own. They are successful but become lost in a labyrinth of mineshafts and caverns. At the climax of the story, a great battle takes place on a hill near alderley during which the children and their companions make a desperate last stand to protect the stone. However the enemy forces prove too strong and Durathror is mortally wounded. Grimnir takes the WeirdStone for himself and, in the ensuing chaos, Nastrond sends the great wolf Fenrir (in some editions Managarm) to destroy his enemies. As the remaining companions begin to despair, Cadelin appears and slays Grimnir, whom he reveals to be his own brother. The Morrigan flees in terror while Cadeelin uses the power of the weirdstone to subdue once again the forces of darkness.

290,The Human Stain,"Coleman Silk is a former classics professor and dean of faculty at Athena College, a fictional institution in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts. Silk is accused of racism by two black students because of referring to them as ""spooks"" Silk begins an affair with Faunia Farley, a 34-year-old local woman who works as a janitor at the college and is married to an abusive Vietnam veteran. Zuckerman gradually learns that Silk is an African American who has presented himself as Jewish (and white) since a stint in the Navy. He completed graduate school, married a white woman and had four children with her. (He never told his wife and children of his mixed ancestry.) As Roth wrote in the novel, Silk chose ""to take the future into his own hands rather than to leave it to an unenlightened society to determine his fate"" The novel is about a man who is forced out of his job after his wife dies of a stroke, which Silk feels is caused by the stress of his being forced out by the college. The novel was written by David Roth and is published by Simon & Schuster on November 14, 2013. The book is available in hardback and e-book versions for $24.99 and $28.99 respectively. It is published in the U.S. by Simon and Schuster, and in the UK by Macmillan, priced £16.99, £18.95 and £19.99.

291,Picnic at Hanging Rock,"Picnic at Hanging Rock centers around a trip by a party of girls from Appleyard College, a fictitious upper class private boarding school. The excursion ends in tragedy when three of the girls, and later one of their teachers, mysteriously vanish while climbing the rock. No reason for their disappearance is ever given, and one of the missing girls who is later found has no memory of what has happened to her companions. A fourth girl who also climbed the rock with the group is of little help in solving the mystery, having returned in hysterics for reasons she cannot explain. The unsolvable mystery of the disappearances was arguably the key to the success of both the book and the subsequent film. The novel is written in the form of a true story, and even begins and ends with a pseudo-historical prologue and epilogue, adding to the overall feeling of mystery. However, while the geological feature, H hanging Rock, and the several towns mentioned are actual places near Mount Macedon, the story is not completely true. Valentine's Day, 14 February 1900 was a Wednesday, not a Saturday as depicted in the story. All attempts by enthusiastic readers to find historical evidence of the event, characters, or even Appleyards College, have proved fruitless. The book suggests that the fictional site of Applyard College might have been on the western side of Calder Highway/Black Forest Drive (C792), about 2–4&nbsp;km south of Woodend. Incidentally, in 1919 this school was transferred to the town of Wood end, Victoria, about 8&ngt;km southwest of H hanging rock. In 1980 a book of hypothetical solutions (by Yvonne Rousseau) was published, called The Murders at Hanged Rock. In fact, Lindsay's original draft included a final chapter in which the mystery was resolved. At her editor's suggestion, Lindsay removed it prior to publication. Chapter Eighteen, as it is known, was published posthumously in 1987 as The Secret of Hanging rock by Angus & Robertson Publishing. The film version of the book was released in 1987. It is based on Lindsay's experiences at Clyde Girls' Grammar School at East St Kilda, Melbourne, which Joan Lindsay attended as a day-girl while in her teens. The school was to some extent based on Clyde Girls’ Grammars School. In 1919, the school was moved to Woodend, Victoria. It was transferred in 1919."
292,"I, the Jury","Dr. Charlotte Manning runs a successful private psychiatric clinic on New York's Park Avenue. In order to increase her profit, she gets involved with a group of criminals &mdash; a ""syndicate"" specialising in both prostitution and drug-trafficking. The brains of the ""outfit"" is Hal Kines, who has had plastic surgery so that he looks much younger than he really is. When Manning sees some old college yearbooks whose contents (and photos), if made public, would expose Kines's double life, she has to act fast. She goes home but on the same night, undetected by Kathy, her maid, goes back to Williams's apartment and shoots him in the stomach using a silencer. She does so in a particularly sadistic way, watching him die slowly. None of the guests at Williams's party has a watertight alibi, but to both Pat Chambers, the cop investigating the murder, and Mike Hammer, a friend of his and private investigator, none of them has a motive either. When Mike Hammer sees Williams's body (""For the first time in my life I felt like crying""), he makes a solemn vow: he promises that he will find the murderer and execute him himself, avoiding the U.S. judicial system altogether. He says that if he left it to the courts to punish the perpetrator, some clever lawyer would surely achieve an acquittal and the murderer would get away with his crime. This is why he himself will be the jury &ndash; and the judge, for that matter. The immediate suspects Hammer finds himself confronted with are: Esther and Mary Bellemy, identical twins in their late twenties living in New York apartment, with a large estate somewhere in the country. Later, Hammer finds out through first-hand experience that Mary Belle my is a nymphomaniac, whom he never gets to know intimately, but is much more reserved than Esther. George Kalecki, whom Hammer knows to have been a crook, is a bootlegger, but who has obviously achieved a clean record and appears to be paying for the latter's tuition and giving him food and lodging. In fact, the other way round is it is George who is giving Hammer the bootleggers' money and giving it to him in a round round, in a way that is more precise than it is in the book. But each of them hopes he'll be the one to find the killer in the end."
293,Thinks ...,"The novel is exclusively set at the (entirely fictitious) University of Gloucester. It is based loosely on the University of York thanks to the author's brief residence there. Its action takes place in the spring term of 1997 (during the time of Tony Blair's landslide victory). ;Helen Reed, a young widow, arrives on campus to spend the term as ""writer-in-residence"" and to teach a creative writing class &mdash. Helen is going through a crisis in her life after the sudden death of her husband Martin a bit more than a year ago. She has not had sex since her husband's death, and, due to her Catholic upbringing, which she has been unable and, to a lesser degree, also unwilling to cast off completely, she tries to thrust aside any thoughts concerning an illicit affair or a one-night stand with Ralph Messenger, who is married with four children. ;Ralph Messenger's philandering is painfully obvious to Helen. Meanwhile, Helen tries to focus on her work, which is mainly about their work in Picknoons, which they started during the term. When Helen discovers that Messenger does not know anything about her real feelings, she thinks that he has passed at her prematurely and, by doing so, has spoiled her future liaison with him. She tells him unmistakably that she is not going to have an affair with him because, among other things, she strongly disapproves of him and by thinking of him, we learn that he is just thinking of her and just thinking about her. The novel is to a large extent about a small, ambitious group of students who meet on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons to work on their novels. The students are mainly made up of women who have just finished their D.Phil. degrees and who are ambitious and ambitious. The novels are mainly about the work in which they have started, and about their progress in getting to the point of writing them. The author has never finished her D. Phil. thesis on point of view in Henry James and her teaching experience so far has been limited to some night class on creative writing full of bored housewives. She is also intrigued by the department specialising in Cognitive Science, and by its head, 50 year-old Ralph Messenger. The Messengers live in a beautiful house near the University but they also have a country retreat in the Cotswolds (quite close to Gloucester) called 'Horseshoes', where they have a large redwood hot tub in their back garden."
294,The Adventures of Pinocchio,"The story begins in Tuscany. A carpenter has found a block of pinewood which he plans to carve into a leg for his table. When he begins, however, the log shouts out, ""Don't strike me too hard!"" Geppetto is extremely poor and plans to make a living as a puppeteer. He carves the block into a boy and names him ""Pinocchio"". As soon as Pinocchio's nose has been carved, it begins to grow longer and longer. After the puppet is finished, Geppeto teaches him to walk and Pinocchi runs out the door and away into the town. He is caught by a Carabiniere and imprisons by a carabineer who says that Geppesetto dislikes children. He meets a fox and a cat who convince him that if he plants his coins in the Field of Miracles, outside the city of Catchfools, then they will grow into a tree with a thousand gold coins, or perhaps two thousand. The ghost of the Talking Cricket appears, telling him to go home and give the coins to his father but he ignores him. As he passes through the forest, the disguised Cat and Fox jump out and try to rob Pinocchy, who hides the money in his mouth. The first two (an owl and a crow) are uncertain, but the Blue-haired Fairy sends a falcon and a poodle to tell her that he has been disobedient and make his father make him a marionette. After a while, the Fox and Cat get tired of the marionettes and leave him in a tree to suffocate and leave. The third (the Talking Cricket) tells Pinocknows that he is fine and that he presumably killed earlier—the third Pinoc Knows that PinocKnows that his father has been hurt and hurt his father and makes him make a marionsette. The fourth (the talking Cricket) tries to tell PinocKNows that the first two are dead, but she calls in three famous doctors, and she tells him he is dead. The fifth (thetalking Cricket) says she is dead and waiting to knock on the door of a white house ahead. However, as he speaks to her, he is greeted by a young Fairy with Turquoise Hair waiting to be taken to the door, and waiting for her to knock. The story ends with Pinoc KNows."
295,Smith of Wootton Major,"Wootton Major was well-known around the countryside for its annual festivals. The biggest festival of all was the Feast of Good Children. This festival was celebrated only once every twenty-four years. The highlight of the party was the Great Cake, a career milestone by which Master Cooks were judged. Various trinkets were hidden in the cake for the children to find. One of these was a star the Cook discovered in the old spice box. The star was not found at the Feast, but was swallowed by a blacksmith’s son. On the morning of his tenth birthday the star fixed itself on his forehead, and became his passport to Faery. The book describes his many travels in Faery, until at last he meets the true Queen of Faery and the identity of the King is also revealed.

296,The Tie That Binds,"In 1896, newlyweds Roy and Ada Goodnough leave Iowa and settle down in northeastern Colorado under the Homestead Act of 1862. Ada regrets leaving Iowa for the plains of Colorado. Her husband turns out to be a bully, an angry and violent man without any sense of humour. When she dies in 1914, aged only 42, Edith has to take over all of Ada's chores and duties (""Your mother's dead. You're the mother now."") Lyman finally sees his chance of escape when, in 1941, the United States is attacked by Japan. He secretly leaves the farm and goes to the city with the intention of joining the armed forces. But at 42 he is too old to enlist and instead embarks on a tour of the U.S. which lasts for more than 20 years. Edith never doubts that one day her brother will return. He does so, too, in the early 1960s, almost ten years after their father's peaceful death at 82. In the spring of 1977 Edith Goodn is still lying in a hospital bed with a policeman stationed outside her room and facing charges of attempted murder every day. The journalists who visit Roscoes Sanders are appalled by the idea of farming life. They have no idea how hard farming life can be, having started sniffing around and digging up dirt. The narrator's grandmother, a half-breed whose husband left her and their little son for good, quietly observes the Goodnougs and also, on Ada's request, helps deliver Edith and Lyman. As the two siblings grow up, they desperately start looking for means of escape. But they soon realize that they are stuck on their father’s farm, that, as opposed to city kids, they are bound by a rural code of honour and a sense of duty and thus prevented from abandoning the farm. It is again Edith whose sense of Duty tells her to look after her brother. In a New Year's Eve, 1976, she has Lyman put on his best clothes, cooks a three-course dinner for him, waits for him to fall asleep and then sets fire to their house. Things do not happen according to plan though because the fire is detected too soon and the two old people are evacuated. But soon it becomes too dangerous for Rena, the narrator's daughter, who is born in 1969, as Lyman, who has regressed to infancy, is prone to unprompted outbursts of violence."

298,Dune,"Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV of House Corrino has come to fear House Atreides due to the growing popularity of Duke Leto Atreide within the Landsraad. The Emperor instead uses the centuries-old feud between House atreides and House Harkonnen to disguise his assault. Leto's concubine, the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, was ordered to give birth to a daughter, but she instead bears a boy, to provide an heir for Leto. The Atreids are able to thwart initial Harksonnen traps and complications while simultaneously building trust with the mysterious desert Fremen, with whom they hope to ally. However, they are ultimately unable to withstand a devastating Hark onnen attack, supported by House CorRino's elite Corps of Sardaukar, disguised as HarkOnnen troops. The House is scattered, with Leto taken captive by Yueh and delivered to the HARKonnens. Paul becomes aware through his prescience that if he is not careful, the Fremen will extend that jihad against all the known universe, which Paul describes as a humanity-spanning effort to avoid genetic stagnation. Paul grows dramatically in influence, and he is regarded as a Fremen messiah in his new name, MuDib'Dib.

299,Feersum Endjinn,"The book is set on a far future Earth where uploading of mindstates into a world-spanning computer network is commonplace. The solar system is drifting into an interstellar molecular cloud, which will eventually dim the Sun's light sufficiently to end life on Earth. The Diaspora (the long-departed segment of humanity) have left behind a device (the ""Fearsome Engine"" of the title) to deal with the problem. The book follows four characters who become involved in the attempt to activate it. A quarter of the book is told by Bascule the Teller and is written phonetically in the first person. This is explained by the dyslexia of the main character, who tells the story in first person in a quarter-person format. The fourth chapter of the Book's Part One opens with: ""I have been given a gift, and I am going to give it to you."" The book's Part Two is titled ""The Fearsome engine"" and follows the story of the four characters involved in trying to activate the device. It is written in first-person, with the narrative moving between the four (who do not meet until very near the end) in rotation. The final chapter of Part One is titled, ""I Have been Given A Gift, I am Going To Give It To You"" and is told from the point of view of the character Bascules, who has been given the gift of a device to help him in his quest for immortality. The last chapter of this chapter is entitled, ""The Fearless Engine"" and tells the tale of the ""Fearless Engine"", a device that allows the dead to be easily reincarnated. The story of this device is told in the second part of the Part One chapter, which is called the ""Fearless Engine"". The book is published by Simon & Schuster in paperback on November 14, 2013. The first edition was published on November 13, 2013, and the second edition is released on November 21, 2014, in hardback and hardback. The price for each copy of the first edition is £12.99. The second edition has been priced at £14.99 (£16.99) and the third edition £15.99 ($19.99), and the fourth edition is priced £18.99 (with the option to buy the second copy for £15).

301,Just Like That,"Edek Zepler is a Holocaust survivor who was born Edek Zeleznikow in Poland in 1915. He got married in the Łódź ghetto to Rooshka but had to marry her again after the war in a DP camp in Germany. In 1951 the family emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. His life takes a decisive turn when, on a visit to New York, he meets Josl and Henia Borenstein again, a couple he last saw in the German DP camp. Edek packs up all his things, sells his house and moves to the U.S.A. He is married to Henia and they have a son, Zachary, now 21, and a daughter, Zelda, now 16, by him. Esther is the only child of Edek andRooshka Zepler. She was born in a GermanDP camp in 1950. In 1968, aged 18, she became a rock journalist - just like Lily Brett herself - and in this capacity also visited New York. She has always seen herself as ""a person with so much to sort out"", and this is why she has been in analysis for a number of years. In the novel, she learns the difference between compulsive behaviour and obsessive behaviour. She is a woman with ""excessive anxieties and indecisions"", likely to face panic and panic when having to face things. She considers herself lucky that you do not really need a car in New York City. She thinks she shows herself as claustrophobia as well as as agoraphobia. She spends a fortune on it and even even even sells her mother's diamond ring in one point. Nobody would guess that Sean, Esther, ZachARY, Zelda and Kate - Sean's 19 year-old daughter by his first wife, who died of cancer - are a patchwork family. For one thing, Sean looks Jewish although he is not; for another, they all understand each other well and there is a certain feeling of belonging amongst them. They all are quite wealthy, they do not suffer from any illnesses - Esther is constantly suffering in some way or other. At one point in the novel she even thinks she is going to drive her father's car in public until they were stopped by the police. They are all quite wealthy and they all are well-behaved - they all have a good job, she is happily married, her children are well behaved and they are all very well-off."
302,Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man,"The story is a series of episodes in the youth of George Sherston, ranging from his first attempts to learn to ride to his experiences in winning point-to-point races. The book as a whole is a frequently humorous work, in which fox-hunting, one of Sassoon's major interests, comes to represent the young man's innocent frame of mind in the years before war broke out. The story is continued in two sequels: Memoirs of an Infantry Officer and Sherston's Progress. ""The Flower-Show Match,"" an account of an annual village cricket match - an important fixture for those involved - in which young Sherston plays a significant part, was later published separately by Faber as a self-contained story. It was later released as a collection of short stories called The Flower- show Match and The Flower Show Match, with the story of the Flower-show Match being the main focus. The title is somewhat misleading, as the book is mainly concerned with a seriesof landmark events in Sherson/Sassoon's childhood and youth, and his encounters with various comic characters. It ends with his enlistment in a local regiment, and the book ends with the end of the Second World War. It has been described as a ""comic masterpiece"" by the author's biographer, David Walliams, who has also written a biography of the author. It is published in hardback, with a front cover that reads: ""Sherston, George, George. George, the Great War. The Great War... The Story of Sherston."" The book also has a back cover that says: ""The Great War... The Story Of Sherston"" The book is also published in paperback with the title: ""George Sherston: The Great Story of George, The Great Race, The Greatest Race."" The back cover says: ""The Great Race... The Great Game, The Story That Saved My Life. The Story that Saved my Life."" It has also been published as a hardback with the name ""The Greatest Race"" and the title ""The Grand Race"". The book has also had a number of other titles, including ""The First World War"" and ""The Last World War,"" as well as two sequels, ""Memoirs Of An Infantry Officer"" and 'Sherston’s Progress'"

304,The Beach,"Richard, a young English traveller, meets a strange Scotsman going by the pseudonym of Daffy Duck. The Scotsman leaves him a hand-drawn map of a supposed hidden beach located in the Gulf of Thailand that is inaccessible to tourists. Richard, Étienne, and Françoise set out to find what they believe must be paradise on earth. When the three travellers finally reach the beach, they are faced with a tight-knit and largely self-sufficient community which has almost completely shut itself off from civilization. Only a select few are chosen by the original founders to come to the island, and thus newcomers who were not given a personal invitation are not welcome, but are not sent away because to do so would jeopardize the secrecy of the community. It is during the Rice Run that Jed finds out that Richard gave a copy of the map to Sammy and Zeph when Jed overheard the two Americans talking about the beach to some German travellers. Richard later discovers that Jed has been assigned by Sal to keep a lookout on the island's perimeter and scope out arriving travellers who had heard word of the beach. In time, Keaty catches a dead squid which poisons most of the residents, and the healthy members remaining struggle to nurse the sick back to normalcy. Richard returns from his duty to find that Bugs has punched him in the face because of the heated argument due to his stoic nature due to Bugs' dislike of nature. Because of this, Richard moves in to partner with Jed and keep a close eye on the impending invasion of the neighbouring island to reassign him to keep the perimeter reassigned.

308,To Kill a Mockingbird,"The main story takes place during three years of the Great Depression in the fictional ""tired old town"" of Maycomb, Alabama. It focuses on six-year-old Scout Finch, who lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Atticus is appointed by the court to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken, as is Atticus', when a hopeless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison. Humiliated by the trial Bob Ewell vows revenge. He spits in Atticus' face on the street, tries to break into the presiding judge's house and menaces Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout as they walk home on a dark night from the school Halloween pageant, but amid the confusion, someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective and regrets that they never repaid him for the gifts he had given them. The book opens with the Finch family's ancestor, Simon Finch, a Cornish Methodist fleeing religious intolerance in England, settling in Alabama, becoming wealthy and, contrary to his religious beliefs, buying several slaves. The children feed each other's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside theRadley place. Several times, the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the kids, but, to their disappointment, never appears in person. For many years few have seen him and for many years many people in Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo. For his part, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus's and Tom's points of view. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella was making sexual advances towards Tom and her father caught her and beat her. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the prudence and ethics of holding Jem or Boo responsible, but eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell fell on his own knife."

The first and last scenes feature a character named Smithers, a white trader who appears to be part of illegal activities. During this scene, Jones is killed by a silver bullet, which was the only way that the rebels believed Jones could be killed, and the way in which Jones planned to kill himself if he was captured.

310,The Go-Between,"Leo Colston is an elderly man looking back on his childhood with nostalgia. The greater portion of the text concerns itself with Leo's past, particularly the summer of 1900. Leo becomes a secret ""go-between"" for Marian Maudsley, the daughter of the host family, and nearby tenant farmer Ted Burgess. Leo's involvement as messenger between the lovers has disastrous consequences. The trauma which results when Marian's family discover what is going on leads directly to Ted's shotgun suicide. In a final twist to the story, 52 years later, Leo returns to Brandham. There he meets Marian's grandson and finds Marian herself in a cottage she had always told people she was going when she was really having clandestine meetings with Ted. Lord Trimingham married Marian, but died in 1910, and Marcus and his brother Denys were killed in the First World War. In the epilogue the older Leo tells the reader the consequences of this summer. The experience profoundly affects Leo, leaving him with permanent psychological scars. He subsequently grows up to be an emotionally detached adult who is never able to establish intimate relationships. He succeeds in repressing the memories until the diary unlocks them. Now looking back at the events through the eyes of a mature adult, he is fully aware of how the incident has left its mark on him.

312,A Christmas Carol," Dickens divides the book into five chapters, which he labels ""staves"", that is, song stanzas or verses, in keeping with the title of the book. Scrooge is established within the first stave as ""a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner!"" He hates Christmas, calling it ""humbug"", refuses his nephew Fred's dinner invitation, and rudely turns away two gentlemen who seek a donation from him to provide a Christmas dinner for the Poor. His only ""Christmas gift"" is allowing his overworked, underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off with pay - which he does only to keep with social custom. In the fifth and final stave, Scrooges awakens on Christmas morning with joy and love in his heart, then spends the day with his nephew's family after anonymously sending a prize turkey to the Cratchesit home for Christmas dinner. The story closes with the narrator confirming the validity, completeness and permanence of ScrooGE's transformation of the spirit of Christmas. It is the first of a series of Christmas books by Dickens, which include The Chimes, The Cricket on the Hearth, and The Christmas Carol. The book was published in 1843, exactly seven years after the death of Ebenezer Scrooges business partner, Jacob Marley. The tale begins on a ""cold, bleak, biting"" Christmas Eve in 18 43 exactly 7 years after Marley's death. It ends on Christmas Day in 1844, with Scroodge's son Tiny Tim dying from an illness that had been caused by his neglectful and untended grave. It was the last of Dickens' Christmas books, and he wrote the next two books in the series in 1855 and 1856.

The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, harrows Scrooie with dire visions of the future if he does not learn and act upon what he has witnessed including Tiny Tim's death, and it is shown that Scroo ge has passed away where businessmen planned to attend if lunch is provided."

316,Miss Lulu Bett,"The story concerns a woman, Lulu, who lives with her sister's family, essentially acting as a servant. She does not complain about her position, but is not happy. When her brother-in-law's brother, Ninian, comes to visit, there is a certain attraction between them. While joking around one evening they find themselves accidentally married, due to the laws of the state requiring little more than wedding vows to be recited while a magistrate is in the room for a marriage to count as legal. On learning they actually like the idea of being married, and choose to stick with it. However, within a month Lulu is back home, having discovered that Ninian was already legally married: 18 years prior he had wed a girl who left him after 2 years, and he had actually forgotten about the whole thing. She also notices that her teenage niece, Di, is unhappy, and also seems to be trying to use marriage as a way to escape her circumstance. Lulu eventually has to prevent Di from eloping, and is finally inspired to move out of her sister’s home and live on her own. Two endings were written for the play, the original as seen in December 1920 (and the ending that won Gale the Pulitzer Prize from Drama; the first woman ever to do so) The revised ending is a much less satisfying one, but more typical and would have been a bit more commercially acceptable and far less challenging to the audiences of the day. In this ending Ninian shows up in the nick of time just as Lulu decides to go off on her Own life to work and live elsewhere. He asks her forgiveness and she agrees saying ""I forgave you in Savannah, Georgia."" Lulu says in her final lines, ""Good-by. Good-by, all of you. I'm going I don't know where-to work at I don’t know what. But I’m going from choice!"" The original ending has Lulu starting a life on my own and undertaking adventures of her own as we hear in her last lines. In the revised ending, she says, ""I don'tknow where to work at. IDon't know what, but I'mgoing from choice"" Lulu's final lines: ""I forgive you, my love. I forgive you. You've been a good friend to me. I love you, and I miss you, I love your family, I want to see you again."""

Eventually the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, where he spends the rest of his days attempting to explain the third dimension to his brother. The Square recognizes the connection between the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere's) previous ignorance of other, higher dimensions.

325,Good Omens,"It is the coming of the End Times: the Apocalypse is near, and Final Judgment will soon descend upon the human race. The real Anti-Christ is Adam Young, a charismatic and slightly otherworldly eleven-year-old who has lived a perfectly normal life as the son of typical English parents. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse assemble and the incredibly accurate (yet so highly specific as to be useless) prophecies of Agnes Nutter, seventeenth-century prophetess, are rapidly coming true. Agnes was burned at the stake by a mob because she had foreseen her fiery end and had packed 80 pounds of gunpowder and 40 pounds of roofing nails into her petticoats. She, in fact, decided to publish it only so that she could receive a free author's copy. There is only one copy of the book left, which belongs to her descendant Anathema Device. She teams up with Newton Pulsifer, the descendant of the man who initiated the burning of Agnees, to use the prophesies and find the Antichrist. As Adam blissfully and naively uses his powers, creating around him the world of Just William (because he thinks that is what an English child's life should be like), the race is on to find him&mdash;time is running out.

326,Coraline,"The book is about a girl named Coraline Jones. She and her parents move into an old house that has been subdivided into flats. She discovers a locked door in the drawing room, which has been bricked up. In its place is a long passageway, which leads to a flat identical to her own, inhabited by her Other Mother and Other Father, who are replicas of her real parents. The Other Mother offers Coraline a chance to stay in the Other World forever, if Coraline will allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes. If Coraline wins, she, her parents and the ghost children may go free. If she loses, the Other Mother will not let them go. Coraline overcomes all the other Mother’s obstacles, using her wits and Miss Spink's stone. Back in the real world, Coraline finds her parents safe and with no memory of the afterlife.

327,The Sandman: Dream Country,"Dream Country is the shortest of the eleven Sandman collections, featuring just four issues. Like the sixth collection, Fables and Reflections, and the eighth, Worlds' End, Dream Country consists of short stories that do not have a common storyline running through them. This is the story of a frustrated author, Richard Madoc, whose first book has been released to critical acclaim but who simply cannot write a page of the promised follow-up. He strikes a deal with an elder writer, Erasmus Fry, for Calliope, one of the Muses of Greek mythology, whom Fry had captured earlier in his life, in exchange for a bezoar. Fry kept her imprisoned and regularly raped her, and her presence provided the inspiration for his successful novels. Madoc also takes her captive and has great success in writing, but Calliopes calls upon the triad of witches known by many names, such as the Furies, the Kindly Ones or the Gracious Ladies, for help. They direct her to Morpheus, who we are told was once her lover (this relationship is elaborated on later in the series) Madoc's Book ""Her Wings"" appears in a few other stories by Neil Gaiman including The Last Temptation as a sort of inside joke. Rose Walker is later seen reading Fry's book ""Here Comes a Candle"" in Season of Mists. In the library of Dream, an unfinished book by Erasmos Fry, ""The Hand of Glory"" is seen in season of Mist. One of Madoc’s works, “The Spirit Who Had Half Of Everything"", takes its name from an unused chapter title in an early draft of James Branch Cabell's Figures of Earth. This tale begins with a small, white cat being called by another cat to sneak away from her house one night. They speak of an event in a graveyard that they don’t want to miss. When they arrive, they see that many cats are already there. A Siamese cat comes to tell her story. She becomes disillusioned in human beings and ultimately rejects the life of a pampered pet. Her cause is strengthened when she has a dream that she has entered a boneyard in the Dreaming. A raven with no skin on its head informs her where she can find out exactly why the humans killed her offspring: a cave inhabited by the Dream Lord. She responds by saying that she will only state her business to Dream."
328,The Sandman: Season of Mists,"Morpheus travels to the Dreaming to free his former lover Nada from Hell. He finds that there are many entities who want to control Hell or prevent their enemies from controlling it. This episode sets up the basis for the spin-off comic series Lucifer written by Mike Carey. Susano-o-no-Mikoto, Duma and Remiel later become important characters in thespin-off series Lucifer. Between these deliberations is the story ""In Which The Dead Choose To Stay"", which takes place at a traditional English-school boarding school. His Return and Charles Rowland, #25, takes place in a school which borrows its name from the book. The story ends with Morpheus telling Nada that she will always be welcome in any form that she chooses to take in the Dreamer's world, even if she is reincarnated as a baby. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book versions for $3.99 each. The first two volumes of the series were published in the United States, with the third and fourth being released in the UK in the spring of 2013. The fourth and fifth volumes will be released in Europe in the summer of 2014. The final volume will be published in Australia in the fall of 2014, and the final volume of the first collection of the second collection will come in the Spring of 2015. The last two volumes are available in the U.S. and the UK for $4.95 each, with a suggested retail price of $6.99. The series is published in hardcover in the US and UK by Simon and Schuster, and in Europe by Macmillan Publishing, with an estimated retail value of $9.99 for the two volumes combined of $12.99 and £7.50 for the second and third volumes. The third volume is expected to be released later in the year, and will be the last of the Endless series to feature Morpheus in the Endless universe. It will also be the first to feature the character of Death, who angers Morpheus by taunting him about his intolerant treatment of a former lover, whose story formed the prologue to the second collections, The Doll's House. It is also the last collection to feature an Endless family meeting descending almost immediately into a Endless family argument. It also features a pair of angels sent by God, after Remiel relays a message that as Hell is a reflection of Heaven, its true creator should claim it."
329,Interview with the Vampire,"A vampire named Louis tells his 200-year-long life story to reporter Daniel Molloy. In 1791, Louis was a young indigo plantation owner living south of New Orleans, Louisiana. Distraught with the death of his pious brother, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat, who turns Louis into a vampire. Louis begins to come to terms with his vampire nature but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestsat's total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon. Louis feeds off a plague-ridden young girl one night, who is six years old, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Fearing this, Lestats then turns the girl into a ""daughter"" for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name ""Claudia"". Louis and Claudia seek out more of their kind. They travel throughout eastern Europe first and do indeed encounter vampires, but these vampires appear to be nothing more than animated corpses, mindless and unintelligible. It is only when they reach Paris that they encounter vampires like themselves - specifically, the 400- year-old vampire Armand and his coven, the Théâtre des Vampires. Louis, Madeleine and Claudia live together for a brief time, but all three are abducted by the vampires. Louis eventually returns to the Theatre, killing all the vampires inside and killing the sun as it rises and killing all of them. Louis never recovers from Claudia's death and never fully recovers from the emotional connection between himself and Armand. Louis finds the remains of Thenhen as the sun rises and kills the vampire inside the Theatre. Louis and Madeleines are locked in an open coffin, but are burned to death by the rising sun. Louis then returns to America and leaves the Old World to live as a vampire in the New World. He later returns to Europe and eventually dies as a human vampire in a vampire-infested hotel room. He is eventually reunited with Claudia and the two travel across Europe for several years, but never fully recover from Claudia’s death and the connection between herself and Louis. Louis dies in a battle with the vampires of Paris, where he is eventually killed by the vampire Santiago, a prominent figure among the vampire coven. He then dies in the same hotel room where he first met Claudia and Claudia in 1791. The novel was written by Jean-Claude Van Damme."
330,Seven Against Thebes,"Oedipus, the king of Thebes, realized he had married his own mother and had two sons and two daughters with her. He blinded himself and cursed his sons to divide their inheritance (the kingdom by the sword) Eteocles and Polynices, in order to avoid bloodshed, agreed to rule Thebes in alternate years. After the first year, ETeocles refused to step down and as a result,Polynices raised an army (captained by the eponymous Seven) of Argives to take Thebes by force. This is where Aeschylus' tragedy starts. There is little plot as such; instead, the bulk of the play consists of rich dialogues that show how the citizens of the Thebes feel about the threat of the hostile army before their gates. Due to the popularity of Sophocles's Antigone, the ending of Seven against Thebes was rewritten about fifty years after Aes chylus's death. Where the play was meant to end with somber mourning for the dead brothers, it instead contains an ending that serves as a lead-in of sorts to SophocLES' play. The seven attackers and defenders in the play are: Tydeus, Melanippus, Capaneus, Hippomedon, Hyperbius, Parthenopeus, Amphiaraus, Lasthenes, Megareus, and Eteoclus. The play ends with a messenger announcing that the attackers have been repelled but that EteOCles and polynices have killed each other in battle. Their bodies are brought on stage, and the chorus mourns them. Then, a messenger appears, announcing a prohibition against burying Polynice; Antig one, however, announces her intention to defy this edict. The chorus then sings a choral ode to mark the end of the battle and the bodies of the attackers are brought to the stage to be laid to rest. Then the chorus sings another ode, this time to honor the seven defenders of the seven gates of the city. The final chorus ends with the chorus singing a song of praise for the seven captains of the Argive army and their respective shields. The last chorus is then sung by the chorus of the Seven, who then sing a song in honor of the king and queen, who are then laid to their final resting place at the seventh gate. Then they sing a final chorus to celebrate the victory over the attackers."
331,Tartarin de Tarascon,"The book was followed by two sequels: Tartarin sur les Alpes (1885) and Port-Tarascon (1890) It tells the burlesque adventures of Tartarin, a local hero of Tarascon, a small town in southern France. Tartarin's invented adventures and reputation as a swashbuckler finally force him to travel to a very prosaic Algiers in search of lions. Instead of finding a romantic, mysterious Oriental fantasy land, he finds a sordid world suspended between Europe and the Middle East. And worst of all, there are no lions left. By a coincidence, Tartarin encounters a lion and kills him. Unfortunately, the lion was a mascot of the local military garrison and Tartarin is dragged in front of a judge. But by a stroke of luck, he is released on a technicality and returns to Taras Con with the lion's skin to a hero's welcome. The book was published in 1885 and followed by a sequel in 1890. It was published by J.C. Penney and is available in English, French and Spanish. For more information, visit www.jcpenney.co.uk or www.amazon.com/Tartarin-Sur-Les-Alpes-Port-Tar ascon-Port.

332,The Sandman: The Kindly Ones,"The Kindly Ones is a single storyline written as a Greek tragedy, with Morpheus as its doomed hero and an aspect of the triad of witches, the Erinyes, as the Greek chorus. It pulls together various threads left dangling throughout the series, notably the grudges against Morpheus of several characters. It also continues several other stories, including that of Cluracan of Faerie and his sister Nuala, that of the Corinthian, and that of Rose Walker and her former landlord Hal. Parts from other collections are also important to its story, however, notably elements from Season of Mists and the story of Orpheus, told mostly in Fables and Reflections. In many places, Lyta is depicted as Medusa, even meeting Medusa's two sisters, Stheno and Euryale, at one point in the story. In an affecting sequence, the main story ends withMorpheus and Death on a desolate peak, echoing a sequence from one of the series' early high points, ""The Sound of her Wings"" (issue #8). Death asks for Morpheus' hand, and he simply disappears, in a flash of light. Having existed for all but an eternity, Dream of the Endless dies. Immediately upon the death of Morpheus, Daniel metamorphoses into a new aspect of Dream, with white clothes and hair, and an emerald instead of a ruby. It is never exactly clear to what extent he is aware of the course on which he has, to some extent, set himself, and how serious are his attempts to save himself. In a telling sequence, he finally lays himself open to the Furies by leaving his kingdom to fulfill a boon he had granted to Nuala even though he knows that his own end will likely be the consequence. Once more his refusal to shirk what he perceives as his responsibility for any reason is a turning point of the story, and once more he is unable to stop the Fury from taking their revenge. In the end, Daniel is eventually recovered alive and well by Morpheus's servants, the raven Matthew and a restored Corinthian. But Lyta learns that Daniel is still alive and safe, and is subsequently unable to stopping the F Fury from taking revenge on the witches who agree to help her in her goal. Unbeknownst to Lyta, the witches are empowered to destroy Morpheus by the fact that he has shed the blood of one of his family (that of his son, Orpheus) when he granted him the boon of death."
333,SS-GB,"Douglas Archer is a British homicide detective assigned to Scotland Yard. He is called in to investigate a murder of a well-dressed man in an apartment in Shepherd Market. Archer soon discovers that the dead man was a British physicist named William Spode. Spode was part of a German military team working on developing an atomic bomb. As his investigation proceeds, Archer finds the dangers increasing, as a subordinate is killed and Archer himself is nearly murdered by a member of the Resistance. Archer also develops a romantic relationship with Barbara Barga, an American reporter whom he first met at the Spode murder scene and who appears involved in the mystery. In a final meeting before his execution, Oskar Huth lwhom Archer has deduced was Spode's murderer, has also got what he wanted most: an honourable death for the King, and an incident that will bring about war between Germany and the United States. In the end, Archer is freed by Fritz Kellerman, who has what he wants &ndash; evidence which he can use to convict Huth of aiding the resistance and use that evidence to develop the atomic bomb that Archer will use to use against Huth. The film was released in November 1941, nine months after a German invasion led to the British surrender. It is one of the best-known films of the Second World War, along with ""The Godfather"" and ""The Descendants"" (both of which were released the same year). It was directed by David Lean and co-written by Tom Hanks. It was released on the 50th anniversary of the end of the First World War and the 100th birthday of the Battle of the Bulge. It has been hailed as one of Britain's best-ever films, and has been described as ""a classic"" by many critics. The movie is based on a true story, with many of the main characters based on real-life people and events in the 1930s and 1940s. The screenplay was written by Mark O'Mara, who also served as the editor of The New York Review of Books, and was co-authored by Peter Travers, who served as an assistant editor for The New Yorker and The Paris Review. The book was published by Simon & Schuster, which also published the novel as a hardback, with a foreword written by Simon and Schuster. The novel was also published by Harper Collins, which published it as a paperback, with an abridged version in paperback."
334,Finnegans Wake,"Finnegans Wake comprises 17 chapters, divided into four Books. Book I contains 8 chapters, Books II and III contain 4, and Book IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he had done for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice, however, is to indicate book number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third book. The entire work is cyclical in nature: the last sentence—a fragment—recirculates to the beginning sentence: ""a way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs."" Joyce himself revealed that the book ""ends in the middle of a sentence and begins in themiddle of the same sentence."" I.2 opens with an account of ""Harold or Humphrey"" Chimpden receiving the nickname ""Earwicker"" from the Sailor King. He is then brought low by a rumor that begins to spread across Dublin, apparently concerning a sexual trespass involving two girls in the Phoenix Park, although details of HCE's transgression change with each retelling of events. HCE is finally brought to trial, under the name Festy King, and is eventually freed, and goes once more into hiding. An important piece of evidence – a letter about HCE written by his wife ALP – is called for so that it can be examined in closer detail in I.5. This letter was dictated by ALP to her son Shem, and entrusted to her other son Shaun, a postman, for delivery to a midden heap where it is unearthed by a hen named Biddy. In the two chapters of Book I we learn more about the letter's writer the Penman (I7) and its original author, his mother ALP. The final chapter consists of ""Shaun's assassination of his brother Shem"", describing the death of his mother [PAL], who appears at the end of the book. I.6 digresses from the narrative in order to present the main and minor characters in more detail in the form of twelve riddles and answers. The book reaches its ending up in a letter never before seen in a writer."
335,The Virgin Suicides,"The Lisbons are a Catholic family living in Grosse Pointe, Michigan in the 1970s. Their lives change dramatically within one summer when Cecilia, a stoic and astute girl described as an ""outsider"", attempts suicide by cutting her wrists. Lux begins a romance with local heartthrob Trip Fontaine. Trip negotiates with the overprotective Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon to take Lux to a homecoming dance, on the condition that he finds dates for the other three girls. After having sex with Trip on the high school football field after the dance, Lux misses her curfew. Consequently, the Lisbons become recluses and their house falls into a deeper state of disrepair.

The Lisbon girls become increasingly fascinating to the neighborhood in general and the narrator boys, the narrators of the novel. The mystique of the LisbonGirls operates also for the neighborhood boys. The Lisbons' lives are popular subjects of neighborhood gossip. The cause of Cecilia's suicide and its after-effects on the family are popular Subjects of gossip.

336,What Makes Sammy Run?,"Told in first person narrative by Al Manheim, drama critic of The New York Record, this is the tale of Sammy Glick, a young uneducated boy who rises from copy boy to the top of the screenwriting profession in 1930s Hollywood. Manheim recalls how he first met the 16-year-old Glick when Sammy was working as a copy boy at Manheim's newspaper. In the film industry, Manheim remarks at one point in the novel, it is the rule rather than the exception that ""convictions are for sale,"" with people double-crossing each other whenever the slightest chance presents itself to them. The bosses prefer to have carte blanche when dealing with their writers, ranging from having them work on a week-to-week basis to giving them a seven-year contract. The one connection between Sammy's childhood days and his present position seems to be Sheik, someone who went to school with him and regularly beat him up. Now Sheik is working as Glick's personal servant (or almost slave)—possibly some kind of belated act of revenge on Sammy's part, or the ""victim's triumph"". Manheim becomes an eyewitness to the birth of what was to become the Writers Guild, an organization created to protect the interests of the Screenplay Writers Guild. He comes to understand, at least to some degree, ""the machinery that turns out Sammy Glicks"" and ""the anarchy of the poor"" Manheim realizes that Sammy grew up in the ""dog-eat-dog world"" of New York's Lower East Side (Rivington Street), much like the more sophisticated dog- eat- dog world of Hollywood. He feels that he is about to kill two birds with one stone with his girlfriend, Laurette Harrington, the daughter of a Wall Street banker, when he meets Glick at a reception, and genuinely falls in love with this ""golden girl"" At the reception, Glick meets Laurete's daughter, Laurete Atte, and immediately falls inLove with this girl, who is unceremoniously thrown out of the reception by the film company's financiers. When Glick sees his chance to get rid of Fineman altogether and take his place with his new girlfriend, he feels about two stone with one bird with two stone, and feels about one birds with two birds. When the film of Girl Steals Boy opens, Sammy is credited for ""original screenplay"" and Blumberg is not acknowledged."
337,The Razor's Edge,"Maugham characterises his story as not really a novel but a thinly veiled true account. He includes himself as a minor character, a writer who drifts in and out of the lives of the major players. Larry Darrell's lifestyle is contrasted throughout the book with that of his fiancée’s uncle, Elliott Templeton, an American expatriate living in Paris. Larry's proclivities tend towards the 13th century Flemish mystic and saint John of Ruysbroeck. Maugham dedicates the tale after Sophie has been murdered with an inscribed book by Baudelaire and Rimbaud in her room in Antibes, France. He is drawn back into the tale when police interrogate him in Toulon, where she has returned to smoking opium and promiscuity. But his outlook on death is somewhat positive: ""I have always moved in the best society in Europe, and I have no doubt that I shall move in heaven in the next life"" He also reveals how, through deep meditation, Larry goes on to realize God and thus become a saint—in the process gaining liberation from the cycle of human suffering, birth and death that the rest of the earthly mortals are subject to. The book is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99, and is available in hardback for £12.99 and paperback for £14.99.

339,King Solomon's Mines,"Allan Quatermain is an adventurer and white hunter based in Durban, in what is now South Africa. He is approached by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother. They take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class. They cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as Kukuanaland. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of IsiZulu. They soon meet a party of Kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth. They are brought before King Twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. She shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove. The Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to desert, assuring him that they must return to their own people. They eventually return to Durban and eventually to wealthy England, promising them that they will be venerated among his people and honoured among his. They find a different route, unable to go forward or back to an oasis by a broken leg, by which time they find themselves stranded in a different part of the desert. They then join Ignosi's army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel. They also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon's Mines. After the men prepare to be crushed under the stone door, they prepare to die also – but not before fatally stabbing Foulata, who had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle. It takes all Quater main's skill to save his life. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. He comes to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die."

His erstwhile captain Leclère, a supporter of the exiled Napoléon I, found himself dying at sea. On the eve of his wedding, Fernand, Danglars, and Villefort send an anonymous note accusing him of being a Bonapartist traitor. In order to silence him, he condemns him without trial to life imprisonment. After years of friendship, and knowing himself to be close to death, Faria tells him the location of the treasure, on Monte Cristo. He fakes an injury and convinces the smugglers to temporarily leave him on the island, then makes his way to the hiding place. He recovers the treasure and buys both the island and the title of Count from the Tuscan government. Disguised as the rich Count, he takes revenge on the three men responsible for his unjust imprisonment: Fernand, now Count de Morcerf and MercéDès' husband. He also becomes with the Baron Franz d'Épinay, the son of the young Viscount Albert d' Épinay. The Count appears first in Rome, where he becomes acquainted with the young MorcerF. He then moves to Paris, and becomes the sensation of the city. Due to his knowledge and rhetorical power, even his enemies, who do not recognize him, find him charming and desire his friendship. He is eventually rescued by the bandit Luigi Vampa before rescuing him from the same bandit before he is captured by the same group of men. He eventually persuades the Count to extend him a credit of six million francs and withdraws him from his enemies' clutches. He dies in Paris in 1820, but not before he has made his fortune and become the richest man in the city, even though his enemies do not recognise him. He later dies in a car crash in Paris, having lost all of his wealth and power. He leaves behind a wife and three children. He has a son with the Count of Montpellier, and a daughter with a wealthy banker, who is now living in Paris.

344,Excellent Women,"The book details the everyday life of Mildred Lathbury, a spinster in her thirties in 1950s England. Perpetually self-deprecating, but with the sharpest wit, Mildred keeps busy with near-romances, church jumble sales, and of course the ubiquitous cup of tea. Mildred's life grows more exciting with the arrival of new neighbours, anthropologist Helena Napier and her handsome, dashing husband, Rocky. Through the Napiers, she meets another anthropologist, Everard Bone, and it is with him that Mildred will eventually form a relationship. A sub-plot revolves around the activities of the local vicar, Julian Malory, who becomes engaged to a glamorous widow, Allegra Gray. Eventually matters come to a head and Allegra leaves the vicarage after a quarrel. In the meantime, Helena, who has been on the verge of leaving Rocky for Everard, accepts that Everard does not care for her and leaves the neighbourhood, along with Rocky. As with most of Pym's books, the plot is less important than the precise drawing of the comic characters (such as Everard's elderly mother who is obsessed with birds) and situations.

348,The Closing of the American Mind,"Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind is a critique of the contemporary university and how Bloom sees it as failing its students. Bloom's critique extends beyond the university to speak to the general crisis in American society. Bloom argues that commercial pursuits had become more highly valued than love, the philosophic quest for truth, or the civilized pursuits of honor and glory. He cites the pop-star Mick Jagger as a cardinal representative of the hypocrisy and erotic-sterility of pop-music. Pop music employs sexual images and language to enthrall the young. Bloom claims that Jagger is a hero to many university students who envy his fame and wealth. Along with the absence of literature in the lives of young people, the first part of Closing tries to explain the current state of education in a fashion beyond the purview of an economist or psychiatrist——to explain the leading umpires of contemporary culture's leading uppires and their sexual but often unerotic relationships, the author says. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced £16.99, with a print run of 2,500 copies.

349,Murder in the Cathedral,"The play chronicles the days leading up to the martyrdom of Thomas Becket following his absence of seven years in France. Becket's internal struggle is the main focus of the play. The book is divided into two parts. Part one takes place on December 2, 1170. Part II takes place in the Archbishop's Hall and in the Cathedral. Four knights arrive with ""Urgent business"" from the king. They had heard the king speak of his frustration with Becket, and had interpreted this as an order to kill Becket. They accuse him of betrayal, and he claims to be loyal. He tells them to accuse him in public, and they make to attack him, but priests intervene. The chorus sings that they knew this conflict was coming, that it had long been in the fabric of their lives, both temporal and spiritual. Thomas is taken to the Cathedral, where the knights break in and kill him. The Interlude is a sermon given by Becket on Christmas morning 1170, about the strange contradiction that Christmas is a day both of mourning and rejoicing. He announces at the end of his sermon, ""it is possible that in a short time you may have yet another martyr"". We see in the sermon something of Becket’s ultimate peace of mind, as he elects not to seek sainthood, but to accept his death as inevitable and part of a better whole. The Chorus is a key part of the drama, with its voice changing and developing during the play, offering comments about the action and providing a link between the audience and the characters and action, as in Greek drama. The play begins with a Chorus singing, foreshadowing the coming violence. It ends with the knights step up, address the audience, and defend their actions. The murder was all right and for the best: it was in the right spirit, sober, and justified that the church would not undermine stability and state power. In the end, Becket again says he is ready to die, and the chorus again reflects on the coming devastation. The last temptation is the greatest treason: :To do the right deed for the wrong reason. You, my Lord, :In being with us, would fight a good stroke. You hold the keys of heaven and hell. :Power to bind and loose : bind, Thomas, bind, :King and bishop under your heel. :King, emperor, bishop, baron, king: Becket responds to all of the tempters and specifically addresses the immoral suggestions of the fourth tempter."
350,The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"The story is set in 1790 in the countryside around the Dutch settlement of Tarry Town (historical Tarrytown, New York) Sleepy Hollow is renowned for its ghosts and the haunting atmosphere that pervades the imaginations of its inhabitants and visitors. The most infamous spectre in the Hollow is the Headless Horseman, said to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper who had his head shot away by a stray cannonball during ""some nameless battle"" The ""Legend"" relates the tale of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky and extremely superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut, who competes with Abraham ""Brom Bones"" Van Brunt, the town rowdy, for the hand of 18-year-old Katrina Van Tassel. The tension between the three is soon brought to a head when the ghoul clambers over the bridge, rears his horse, and hurls his decapitated head into IchabOD's terrified face. The next morning, Ichabid has mysteriously disappeared from town, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones, who was said ""to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichbod was related"" The story implies that the ghost was really Brom (an agile stunt rider) in disguise. Irving's narrator concludes, however, by stating that the old Dutch wives continue to promote the belief that Ichabods was ""spirited away by supernatural means"" and a legend develops around his disappearance and sightings of his melancholy spirit. The only relics of the schoolmaster's flight are his wandering horse, trampled saddle, discarded hat, and a mysterious shattered pumpkin. The story is left open to interpretation, but the nature of the headless horseman is said to ""vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone"" upon crossing the Old Dutch Burying Ground, where the Hessian is saidto have been killed in a battle of the American Revolutionary War. It is also possible that the story is a fabrication by the author to make money from the book. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, a division of Random House, on November 14, 2013. The first edition of the book was published by Random House for £12.99 (with a suggested retail price of £8.99). The second edition is expected to be published on November 25, 2013, and will be published by Penguin Books for £13.99. The third edition will be released on November 26, 2013 (with an estimated retail price for the book of £10.95 (including the p&p)."
351,The Thirty-nine Steps,"Richard Hannay, an expatriate Scot, returns from a long stay in southern Africa to his new home, a flat in London. One night he is buttonholed by a stranger, a well-travelled American, who claims to be in fear for his life. The man appears to know of an anarchist plot to destabilise Europe, beginning with a plan to assassinate the Greek Premier, Karolides, during his forthcoming visit to London. Four days later Hannay returns home to find Scudder dead with a knife through his heart. Hannay fears that the murderers will come for him next, but cannot ask the police for help because he is the most likely suspect for the murders. Not only does he want to avoid imprisonment, but he also feels a duty to take up Scudder's cause and save Karolide from the assassination, planned in three weeks' time. He decides to go into hiding in Scotland and then to contact the authorities at the last minute. In order to escape from his flat unseen, he bribes the milkman to lend him his uniform and exits wearing it. He catches an Anglo-Scottish express train leaving from London St Pancras station. The next morning he reads in a newspaper that the police are looking for him in Scotland. Miraculously, he meets a road mender out on the moor, and swaps places with him, sending the workman home. His disguise fools his pursuers, who pass him by. By this time, Hannay is being pursued by an aeroplane, and a policeman in a remote village has tried to stop him. He manages to stay ahead of pursuers in a cottage in Beattock, south-west Scotland. Unfortunately, the man turns out to be one of the enemy and with his accomplices he is locked out of the room in which he is full of bomb-making materials, which he uses to make a bomb. A day later, he retrieves his possessions from the helpful roadmender and stays for a few days to recover from the explosion. He dines at a Public House in Moffat before walking to the Foreign Office to meet Sir Harry's relative at the Reading Public House. Sir Harry invites him to address an election meeting that afternoon, and Hannay feels able to trust him with his story. He leaves Sir Harry and tries to hide in the countryside, but is spotted by a group of men on the ground searching for him. The following day, he escapes, finding an inn where he stays the night. He tells the innkeeper a modified version of his story, and is persuaded to shelter him."

354,Nibelungenlied,"The Nibelungenlied was written in Middle High German. The poem is divided into two parts, the first dealing with the story of Siegfried and Kriemhild, the wooing of Brünhild and Siegfried's death at the hands of Hagen. The first chapter introduces the court of Burgundy, the virgin sister of King Gunther, and his brothers Gernot and Giselher. The second part deals with the marriage to Etzel, her plans for revenge, the journey of the Burgundians to the court, and their last stand in Etzel's hall. The original version of the poem began with the introduction of the protagonist of the work, which is believed to have been a late addition to the text, composed after the body of the poems had been completed. The opening verses are believed to be from the poem's preface, which promises both joyous and dark tales ahead. The preface ends with the words: ""Full many a wonder is told us in stories old, of heroes worthy of praise, of hardships dire, of joy and feasting, of weeping and of wailing; of the fighting of bold warriors, now ye may hear wonders told"" The poem has been translated into English, French, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Finnish and Swedish. It was written by the German playwright Hans Holbein, who was also the author of the Aesop's fable of the same name, and was published in 1283. The epic is set in the fictional city of Isenstein in Iceland, where Gunther requests Siegfried to sail with him to win the hand of Iceland's Queen, BrüNhild. Siegfried agrees, though only if Gunther allows him to marry Gunther's sister, whom Siegfried pines for. Gunther becomes afraid that Siegfried may yet be planning to kill them, so Siegfried goes invisibly to Nibelenland to kill Nibelun, the dragon who killed his brother Schilbung. After seeing Siegfried kill the dragon, it becomes apparent to the group that Brühild is immensely strong and they fear for their lives. After Siegfried wins the trial of strength with her hand in marriage as a reward, they will be sentenced to death. If they lose, Siegfried is sentenced to three athletic contests, throwing a javelin, tossing a boulder and a leap and becoming a single man. The group of 12 men then set sail for Iceland."

Only the reader/viewer knows that Mitchell Stephens, the lawyer, has himself effectively lost his own child&mdash;his estranged, drug-addicted daughter informs him over the phone that she has just tested HIV positive. Only her father knows why, but he is unable to publicly reveal his daughter's motives. All the people involved know that Nichole Burnell is lying but cannot do anything about it. When she unexpectedly accuses Dolores Driscoll, the driver, of speeding and thus causing the accident, all hopes of ever receiving money are thwarted. The case now depends on the few surviving witnesses to say the right things in court. Only Nichole knows that she is lying and can't do anything to stop her. The story ends with Nichole telling her father she is HIV positive and that he must leave her alone to deal with it. She is now unable to move from the waist down (but isn't paralysed), but is still able to look after her younger brother, who is also in the same school as her and is a good friend of the family. The parents are reluctant to do so, but eventually they are persuaded by the lawyer that filing a class action lawsuit would ease their minds and also be the right thing to do. When Nichole accuses the driver of speeding, she does so, and the case is settled out of court and all hopes are put in the hands of the parents. The family is left devastated and Nichole is left unable to go back to school. The children are left orphaned and their father is forced to leave his job as a carpenter.

358,Coming Up for Air,"The themes of the book are nostalgia, the folly of trying to go back and recapture past glories and the easy way the dreams and aspirations of one's youth can be smothered by the humdrum routine of work, marriage and getting old. It is written in the first person, with George Bowling, the forty-five-year-old protagonist, who reveals his life and experiences while undertaking a trip back to his boyhood home as an adult. Bowling relates his life history, dwelling on how a lucky break during the First World War landed him in a comfortable job away from any action and provided contacts that helped him become a successful salesman. The concept of ""you can't go home again"" hangs heavily over Bowling's journey, as he realizes that many of his old haunts are gone or considerably changed from his younger years. Throughout the adventure he receives reminders of impending war, and the threat of bombs becomes real when one lands accidentally on the town. The final disappointment is to find that the estate where he used to fish has been built over and the secluded and once hidden pond that contained the huge Carp he always intended to take on with his fishing rod, but never got around to, has become a rubbish dump. In his eyes she has been so ravaged by time that she is almost unrecognizable and is utterly devoid of the qualities he once adored. She fails to recognize him at all. The social and material changes experienced by Bowling since childhood make his past seem distant. This painful memory seems to have sensitized him to - and given him a repugnance for - what he sees as the marching ravages of ""Progress"". He usually finds Old Porteous entertaining, but on this occasion his dry dead classics make Bowling even more depressed. He decides to use the money on a 'trip down memory lane', to revisit the places of his childhood. He recalls a particular pond with huge fish in it which he had missed the chance to try and catch thirty years previously. Eventually he locates the old pub where he is to stay, finding it much changed. Only the church and vicar appear to be the same but he has a shock when he discovers an old girlfriend, for in his eyes they have been almost unrecognisable and are utterly unrecognizable. He finds the place unrecognisable. His home has been transformed into a tea shop. His old girlfriend fails torecognize him atAll. The last time he saw her was at a Left Book Club meeting where he was horrified by the hate shown by the anti-fascist speaker, and bemused by the Marxist ramblings."
359,Shadow Puppets,"Peter, Ender's brother, is now Hegemon of Earth. Peter had planned for Bean to operate the mission, but at the last minute assigns Suriyawong, a battle school student from Thailand, to rescue Achilles in transport. Bean believes Peter has seriously underestimated Achilles, and that he (Bean) is not safe unless he is hidden. During their travels, Petra convinces Bean to marry her and have children with her by taking him to Anton, the person who Anton's Key was named after. Bean is reluctant to have children, as he does not want his Anton'skey gene to be passed on. The novel ends with Peter restored as Hegemonic, Petra reunited with Bean, and the world's Muslims reunited with a Caliph in command of the world’s Muslims, a China severely reduced in territory and forced to accept humiliating surrender terms. The original doctor who activated the key in Bean's genes, Volescu, has him prepare nine embryos through artificial insemination. One of the remaining six is implanted into Petra, while the rest of them are placed under guard. In the previous novel, China had conquered India and Indochina. Alai plans to liberate them by invading first China (in a feint), and then India (once China has withdrawn its armies to defend the homeland). His invasion is successful, and in the midst of realizing their danger, the Chinese government disavows Achilles, providing evidence that he stole the missile launcher that destroyed the decoy space shuttle. Left with nowhere to turn, Achilles contacts Bean and offers the embryos in exchange for safe passage. Achilles expects Bean to be so besotted with the idea of retrieving his children that he can be killed with a bomb in the transport container for them. When Bean sees through that trap, Achilles offers up fake embryos in petri dishes, expecting to lure Bean into a vulnerable position. However, Bean has already decided that Achilles was faking and refuses to fall for any of his traps. Finally, Bean pulls out a pistol and shoots him in the eye. Thus, Achilles is killed in a similar fashion to his first victim Poke, who he killed witha knife to the eye earlier in the series. Peter and his parents escape to the colonization platform in space that used to be the battle school, relying on the protection of Colonel Graff, the former commander of that school, now Minister of Colonization. Shortly after they arrive, however, a message is sent betraying their presence. The unmanned shuttle sent as a decoy is shot down over Brazil (the location of the former compound of the Hegomon, now occupied by Achilles."

364,Restoree,"Restoree is the story of Sara, an introverted, beak-nosed, 24-year-old virgin librarian from New York who is abducted by the Mil. She is kept alive, with her skin removed and in a catatonic state from the physical and mental shock, on a meat hook as a Mil meal until the alien ship she is on is captured by human inhabitants of the planet Lothar. Without her skin, some Lotharians mistake her for one of their own and perform controversial ""restoration"" procedures on her, including a nose job. Sara comes to her senses in a mental institution with no memory of what happened, little knowledge of the local language, and a beautiful, golden-skinned body. At the institution, she is treated as if she were retarded and given menial tasks to do, as are other ""restorees"" who have been clandestinely salvaged from Mil ships. It is apparently some factor of Sara's Terran origins that allows her to fully recover from the shock of the Mil ordeal, while Lotharian restorees are of limited intellect at best. One of her jobs is to care for Harlan, the deposed planetary regent, who is being drugged into a moronic state. Recognizing what is being done, Sara helps Harlan to regain his senses and escape the mental institution. Sara and Harlan then gain the advantage over Harlan's political enemies, defeat the Mil, solve some of Lothor's emerging domestic problems and, of course, fall in love.

He is left in the end naked of everything,. with the drift towards death. Lawrence summarized the plot in a letter to Edward Garnett on 12 November 1912: It follows this idea: a woman of character and refinement goes into the lower class, and has no satisfaction in her own life. She has had a passion for her husband, so her children are born of passion, and have heaps of vitality. But as her sons grow up she selects them as lovers, first the eldest, then the second. But when they come to manhood, they can't love, because their mother is the strongest power in their lives, and holds them. As soon as the young men come into contact with women, there's a split. Lawrence: ""It's rather like Goethe and his mum and Frau von Stein and Christiana &MDash;... The son loves his mother andmdash""; all the sons love his mother &mdAsh; the son loves and is jealous of his father; he is jealous and resentful of his mother; he wants to be with his father, but he can't be with him. He wants to leave her but wants to go out on his own, and needs to experience love. He leaves Miriam behind as he grows more intimate with Clara, but even she cannot hold him. When his mother dies soon after, he is alone. When he meets Miriam's family's farm, Paul meets Clara Dawes, a young woman with feminist sympathies who has separated from her husband."

373,The Prince,"Machiavelli's work has a recognizable structure, for the most part indicated by the author himself, which can be summarized as follows. The Prince starts by describing the subject matter it will handle. New states are either totally new, or they are “mixed” meaning that they are new parts of an older state, already belonging to that prince. Machiaveelli generalizes that there were several virtuous Roman ways to hold a newly acquired province, using a republic as an example of how new princes can act. In some cases the old king of the conquered kingdom depended on his lords. 16th century France, or in other words France as it was at the time of writing of the Prince, is given by Machavelli as an examples of such a kingdom. The solution is to eliminate the old bloodline of the prince, to illustrate this point. The Medici, if they think about it, will find this historical example similar to the ""Ottoman Empire"" in their time - making this potentially easier to hold than France would be. Gilbert Gilbert notes that this chapter is quite atypical of any previous books for princes for the need to discuss conquering free republics. He also notes that holding a state is highly difficult for a prince, making it clear that holding such a state in any case makes it even more difficult for such a prince to hold it in the first place. He thinks MachiaVElli may have been influenced by Tacitus as well his own experience, but finds no clear predecessor for this. This categorization of regime types is also ""un-Aristotelian"" and apparently simpler than the traditional one found for example in Aristotle's Politics, which divides regimes into those ruled by a single monarch, an oligarchy, or by the people, in a democracy. In the opening of his Education of Cyrus he says that, concerning the knowledge of how to rule human beings, Cyrus the Great, his exemplary prince, was very different ""from all other kings, both those who have inherited their thrones from their fathers andThose who have gained their crowns by their own efforts"". Xenophon, on the other hand, made exactly the same distinction between types of rulers in the opening. of his education of Cyrus where he said that Cyrus the great was different from all other king, both in terms of his personal character and his methods of rule. In Chapter 2, he deals with hereditary princedoms quickly in order to show how easy it is to rule them."
374,Sounder,"A black sharecropper's family is poor and hungry. The father and his dog, Sounder, go hunting each night, but the hunting is poor. The family subsists on fried corn mush, biscuits, and milk gravy until one morning they wake up to the smell of boiling ham.

The arrested man's son goes looking for Sounder but cannot find him anywhere. Despite their deaths, there is a sense of peace and resolution over the family—especially over the boy, who has achieved the single thing he most wanted in the world, which is achieving his literacy. The boy leaves and finds a school where he tries to wash the blood off of his hands. He eventually meets an old teacher who takes him in, dresses his wounds, and asks what has happened to him.

381,Satyricon,"The Satyricon is regarded by classicists such as Conte and Rankin as emblematic of Menippean satire. The work is narrated by its central figure, Encolpius, a former gladiator. In his insightful depiction of everyday Roman life, Petronius delights in exposing the vulgarity and pretentiousness of the illiterate and ostentatious millionaires of his age. The surviving sections of the novel begin with EncolPius traveling with a companion and former lover named Ascyltos, who has joined him on numerous escapades. An orgy ensues and the sequence ends with EnColpius and Quartilla exchanging kisses while they spy through a keyhole at Giton having sex with a virgin girl; and finally sleeping together (26). This section of the Satyricson takes place a day or two after the beginning of the extant story, and takes place at the estate of Trimalchio, a freedman of enormous wealth, who entertains his guests with ostENTatious and grotesque extravagance. The next day, En Colpius wakes to find that a fire has broken out in his inn, and uses this sudden alarm as an excuse to get rid of the sophist Agamemnon, whose company he had been with. The story ends with the end of the story, in which the characters are reunited with their former lover, Giton, who is now a boy of about 12 years old. The novel was written between 4th and 5th century BC. It is thought to have been written in the reign of Claudius VII, who was assassinated in 4th century BC. It was first published in Rome in 472, and has since been republished by the Library of Congress in a number of editions, including a new edition in 18th century editions. It has been described as one of the most important works of classical literature, along with the works of Sophocles and Diderot. The author is also known for his use of the term ""frivolous"" to refer to the excesses of the rich and powerful, and for his satire of the Roman elite, such as his depiction of the aristocrats of the time. He also used the word ""sadness"" to describe the suffering of the poor, which he called the ""sufferers"" in the novel. The ending of the book is said to have made him cry out for help, and he was eventually rescued by a porter."
382,"Guns, Germs, and Steel","Eurasia was the beneficiary of favorable geographic, climatic and environmental characteristics, particularly after the last Ice Age about 13,000–15,000 years ago. Diamond argues that Eurasian civilization is not so much a product of ingenuity, but of opportunity and necessity. Agricultural production leads to food surpluses, which supports sedentary societies, specialization of craft, rapid population growth, and specialization of labor. Large societies tend to develop ruling classes and supporting bureaucracies, which may lead in turn to the organization of nation states and empires. Although agriculture arose in several parts of the world, Eurasia gained an early advantage due to the greater availability of suitable plant and animal species for domestication. The book uses geography to show how Europeans developed such superior military technology, and how Europeans and Asians developed some immunity to diseases which spread among them, while epidemics of them devastated the indigenous populations in the Americas after European contact. In contrast, Native American farmers had to struggle to develop maize as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, teosinte; moreover, it provides few nutrients and must be planted one by one&nbsp;– an extremely cumbersome task. The first step towards civilization is the move from hunter-gatherer to agriculture, with the domestication and farming of wild crops and animals. Grains such as bananas can also be stored for longer periods of time unlike tropical species, unlike tropical Grains can also can be stored of greater time. Sub-Saharan Africans had mostly wild mammals, whereas Eurasians are mostly chanced to have the most large animals on the planet: camels and camels. Diamond describes the principle of Anna Karenina as an instance of the promising breeds of domesticated species: Karenina horses, llama and alpaca as well as the llama, camels, llamas and alpacas within the same species; the rest of world none at all. He proposes explanations to account for such disproportionate distributions of power and achievements. He believes this is due to Eurasian societies' military and political advantages, stemming from the early rise of agriculture after thelast Ice Age. He also argues that Europeans have just one of the few promising species of docile animals that are just one small number of ""candidates"" (14 out of 148) as an example of the type of species that can be domesticated in Eurasia. He says Europeans have the potential to be the world's greatest innovators and inventors, but they have to work hard to achieve their goals."

Lucy Honeychurch is touring Italy with her overbearing older cousin and chaperone, Charlotte Bartlett. In Rome, Lucy spends time with Cecil Vyse, whom she knew in England. Cecil proposes to Lucy twice in Italy; she rejects him both times. As Part Two begins, Lucy has returned to Surrey, England to her family home, Windy Corner, and this time she accepts. Cecil is a sophisticated and ""superior"" Londoner who is desirable in terms of rank and class, even though he despises country society. Lucy's brother, Freddy, invites George to play tennis with him at Windy corner, and they enjoy themselves so much they end up running around the bushes and running through the woods. Cecil thinks Lucy's mother is a snob as she thinks a comeuppance to the young man brought them to the village's landlord, whom Cecil thinks to be the new cottage's landlord. Lucy is initially mortified, but Freddy later invites him to bathe in a nearby pond, in the woods, and take off their clothes and swim in the water. Lucy and Freddy later meet the Emersons in Santa Croce, where Lucy meets them again. Lucy observes how boyish George is. As they stop to look over the River Arno before making their way back to the hotel, they have an intimate conversation. Lucy asks George to retrieve some photographs of hers that happen to be near the murder site. George, out of confusion, throws her photographs into the river because they were spotted with blood. After this, Lucy decides to avoid George, partly because she is confused by her feelings and partly to keep her cousin happy—Miss Bartlett is wary of the eccentric Emerson, particularly after a comment made by another clergyman, Mr. Eager, that Mr. Emerson ""murdered his wife in the sight of God"" Mr. Beebe persuades the pair to accept the offer, assuring Miss Bartlett that Mr Emerson only meant to be kind. The next day, Lucy embarks on a tour of Florence with another guest, Miss Eleanor Lavish, a novelist who shows Lucy the back streets of Florence, takes her Baedeker guidebook and subsequently loses her in Florence. The driver is permitted to invite a woman he claims is his sister onto the box of the carriage, and when he kisses her, he promptly forces the lady to get off the carriage box."
386,"Alas, Babylon","Randy (Randolph) Bragg, the protagonist, is a man who dabbles at law and lives a life with little purpose. He lives in the small Central Florida town of Fort Repose, which was founded by an ancestor during the 19th century. Bragg's life appears to be drifting down a somewhat aimless path when he receives a telegram from his older brother, Colonel Mark Bragg. The telegram ends the message with an ominous code: ""Alas Babylon"", a Biblical reference that the Bragg brothers employed throughout their lives as a euphemism for disaster. Mark believes the Soviet plan is flawed and that the West would ultimately prevail, but danger lies in Moscow's belief that they can succeed. This event becomes the apparent casus belli for the Soviet Union to launch a preemptive nuclear strike against the United States and her allies. The brothers soon say their goodbyes, and Randy realizes that he may never see Mark again. He also privately gives warning of the impending war to those people of Fortrepose whom he believes to be his friends, including Dr. Daniel Gunn and Elizabeth ""Lib"" McGovern, a young woman for whom Randy has come to care deeply.

390,"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal","Biff has been resurrected in the present day to complete missing parts of the Bible, supposedly under the watchful eye of the angel Raziel. Biff is made to write down his account of the decades missing from Jesus' life. During these years he and Joshua travel to the East to seek the Three Wise Men (a magician, a Buddhist, and a Hindu Yogi) who attended Joshua's birth so that he may learn how to become the Messiah. Over a span of roughly twenty years, Joshua learns a great deal about human nature, world religions, and how he is able to translate those into his teachings. The recounting of Jesus' human and godlike qualities, combined with Biff's earthy debauchery, leads to its all-too-familiar tragic ending. At the conclusion of the novel, Biff completes ""The Gospel According to Biff"", giving it to Razial, who allows Biff to finally leave the hotel room. As Biff exits into the hallway he is surprised to find a resurrected Maggie exiting the room opposite, having finished her own Gospel weeks ago. The two embrace, informed by an angel that it is ""the will of the Son"" that they be together. In Moore's version, Mary Magdalene is depicted as harboring love for Joshua, though in this version Joshua remains chaste, as per Razile's instructions. This in itself leads to some of Biffs's debauchers, as he is literally attempting to go through enough harlots for both of them. The story takes a fantastical twist on Joshua's miracles as well: he learns to multiply food from one of the Wise Men and learns to become invisible from another; however, his ability to resurrect the dead figures strongly into his first meeting with Biffs when both boys are six years old. The novel also humorously explains many things: the origins of judo (a pun that is definitely intended), why Jews eat Chinese food on Christmas, and why rabbits became associated with Easter. In the final chapter, it is revealed that Biff was essentially ""cut out"" of the story. This leads to a revolving love triangle, leading to the two leaving together, Biffs content to be with Maggie even though he is her second choice. In this version Biff plans to marry if anything happens to Joseph, and Mary (Joshua's mother) all have their part in the life and times of Joshua. The three Wise Men, Mary, Joseph and Mary's mother are all shown in the novel."

He refuses all help, even from his friend Razumikhin, and devises a plan to murder and to rob an unpleasant elderly pawn-broker and money-lender. His motivation comes from the overwhelming sense that he is predetermined to kill the old woman by some power outside of himself. He also receives a letter from his sister and mother, speaking of their coming visit to Saint Petersburg, and his sister's sudden marriage plans which they plan on discussing upon their arrival. As the novel progresses, Raskolnkov is introduced to the detective Porfiry, who begins to suspect him for the murder purely on psychological grounds.

It is for these very reasons that the two of them come to meet Luzkin."
393,The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul,"The central premise of the book is that gods are created by humans' necessity and desire for them. Because nobody worships them, many become destitute, like the tramps whom Dirk witnesses entering Valhalla. Odin makes Thor accidentally transmogrify objects when he gets angry, in a bid to delay him getting to Norway and finding the Draycotts' contract. The gods' world exists in parallel with our own – where St Pancras railway station is Valhalla. At the end of the novel, Dirk's fridge generates a new god of Guilt; it is implied this stops Toe Rag and the green monster from preventing Thor from retrieving the contract in Norway. The eagle that pursues Dirk and Thor is the transformed jet fighter that tries to stop him fromgetting to Norway. One of Dirk's chief characteristics in the novel is guilt—about the fridge and about the death of Anstey, whom he should have protected. This is why he needs to visit the airport at the opening of the novels. It is also why he is unable to fly to Norway using his hammer, and needs to go to the airport to find out how to get to Norway in the first place. He is naive and quite literally unworldly; this is how the Drayscotts are able to take advantage of him. He sees one of Cynthia Draycott's adverts for a soft drink, which seemingly involve various gods promoting the drink; one of these adverts is seen when Dirk confronts AnStey's son early in the book. He makes contact with the DrAYCOTts after seeing one of the adverts, which seems to involve gods promoting a drink. It's implied that this is what leads to his meeting with them.

396,The Railway Children,"The story concerns a family who move to ""Three Chimneys"", a house near the railway. The father, who works at the Foreign office, is imprisoned as a result of being falsely accused of selling state secrets to the Russians. The theme of an innocent man being falsely imprisoned for espionage and finally vindicated might have been influenced by the Dreyfus Affair. The Russian exile, persecuted by the Tsars for writing ""a beautiful book about poor people and how to help them"" was most likely an amalgam of the real-life dissidents Sergius Stepniak and Peter Kropotkin who were both friends of the author. The family take care of Mr Szczepansky, who came to England looking for his family (later located) and Jim, the grandson of the Old Gentleman, who suffers a broken leg in a tunnel. They become friendly with Albert Perks, the station porter, and with the Old gentleman who regularly takes the 9:15 down train. He is eventually able to help prove their father's innocence, and the family is reunited. The book was written a few years before the Dryfus affair was a prominent worldwide news item.

399,Chocolat,"Two strangers, Vianne Rocher, and her small daughter Anouk, move into the small French village of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. They are brought by 'the wind' during the last days of carnival, and they settle and open a chocolaterie, La Céleste Praline. The village priest, Francis Reynaud, is initially mystified, because Lent has just begun, but his confusion turns rapidly to anger when he understands that Vanne holds dangerous beliefs, does not obey the church, and ""flouts"" the unspoken rules that he feels should govern his ""flock"" VianNE is a witch though she does not use the word. Her mother and she were wanderers, going from one city to another. They were born with gifts, and used a kind of ""domestic magic"" to earn their living. When her mother is killed by a cab, she continues on her own, trying to evade the Black Man and the mysetrious force of the wind and settle down to a normal life. She has an innate talent for cooking and a charming personality. She tries to fit in and help her customers. She starts to build a group of regular customers, and, to Reynaud's dismay, she doesn't go out of business. Some people initially stay away, but not for long. His conflict with her becomes his personal crusade. He attempts to have her run out of town, and he talks about her every Sunday at church. But she announces a ""Grand Festival of Chocolate"", to be held on Easter Sunday. Vianene, however, is an old dream of hers, and it is her dream to run a ch chocolateaterie. She also has a daughter, who is more social and passive than her daughter. She is born with a gift for cooking, and uses it to earn her living. Throughout her life, she has been running from the ""Black Man"", a recurring motif in her mother's folklore. When she is killed, she tries to evade it and settles down to the normal life she has always dreamed of. But her daughter is killed and she is left with a daughter who is also a wanderer, who uses her gifts to earn a living. She begins to run away from the town, but some people stay away. Reynaud attempts to get her out of the village, but she refuses to leave. He becomes obsessed with her, and his battle with her is a personal crusade, and becomes his own."
400,The Ghost Road,"Prior has been cured of shell-shock and is preparing to return to France. Rivers, concerned for Prior's safety, finally recognises that his relationship with Prior, and his other patients for that matter, is deeply paternal. This episode is a symbolic capitulation to the inevitability of his death at the Western Front, a fate he shares with the poet, Wilfred Owen to which in a futile battle that takes place a few days before the Armistice, Billy and his friendWilfred Owen are killed. In contrast with upper-class officers like Sassoon, with whom Rivers has been able to form warm friendships, he has always found Prior to be a thorn in his side. As Prior returns to the front, Rivers continues to take care of his patients and his invalid sister. Amid this he reminisces uncomfortably about his childhood and memories of his experience ten years earlier on an anthropological expedition to Melanesia (now Eddystone Island). There, he befriended Nijiru, the local priest-healer who took Rivers on his rounds to see sick villagers and also to the island's sacred Place of the Skulls. In this episode, he takes Rivers on a tour of the island and visits the sacred place of the skulls, which he later visits again with his sister. In the end, Rivers is forced to leave the island to return home to his wife and children. This is a symbol of how he has come to terms with the fact that he will never be able to see his children again, and how he will have to live with the loss of his mother and sister.

The two of them do not quite get along during this first encounter. A duel almost occurs when Aubrey gets elbowed by Maturein to stop beating the time while the string quartet is playing. Later that evening, on his way back to his living quarters, Aubrey finds out that he has been promoted to the rank of Commander and has been given command of the brig Sophie. On her following escort duty, Sophie is captured by a squadron of four large French warships after a pursuit and a brave but hopeless resistance.

As he does this, he and the crew explain many naval matters to MaturIn (and to the reader) since the doctor has never served aboard a man-of-war. The ship's surgeon having left with the previous captain, Matur in is asked by Aubrey in that post. Since he is currently unemployed, he agrees, since he was currently unemployed.

The novel is a whodunit with a place in detective fiction history because it is the first major sendup of that genre. Not only does Trent fall in love with one of the primary suspects, he also, after painstakingly collecting all the evidence, draws all the wrong conclusions.

419,Play,"Samuel Beckett’s Play Skull is one of his most ‘musical’ pieces with ‘a chorus for three voices, orchestration, stage directions concerning tempo, volume and tone, a da capo repeat of the entire action’ Beckett writes that this spotlight ""provokes"" the character's speech, and insists that whenever possible, a single, swivelling light should be used, rather than separate lights switching on and off. In an almost fugal style the three obsess over the affair. Each presents his or her own version of the truth told in the past tense. Clichés and puns abound. The play appears as if it is about to start again for a third time (as in Act Without Words II), but does not get more than a few seconds into it before it suddenly stops. “The affair was unexceptional. From the moment when the man tried to escape his tired marriage and odious professional commitments by taking a mistress, [events took a predictable enough course:] the wife soon began to ‘smell her off him’” Beckett has used similar imagery before, Mahood's jar in The Unnameable, for example, or the dustbins occupied by Nell and Nagg in Endgame. According to John Pillingson and Frescoes, the three figures in Skull are not three-dimensional characters in any way. The stereotype of melodrama and romance in romanticized fiction predominates [They belong to the artificial world ofmelodrama]. The Play Skull: The Three Figures in Play Skull would be absurd to analyse them as if they were absurd, they would predominately be absurd.” – John Knowlson, John Fresco, Fresco and John Pillson, The Play skull: The three figures of Samuel Beckett, abcoes and drama, in later prose and later drama, abes later prose, and in later drama and prose, the later abes and abes of the play Skull.“[I]n the London production, variations were introduced: a weakening of light and voices in the first repeat, and more so in the second; an abridged second opening; increasing breathlessness; changes in the order of the opening words” - Beckett in the notes of the London version of Act Without words, Act without words, Part II, Part III, Part IV, Part V, Part VI, Part VII and Part VII."

In order to save her, he bites her, transforming her into his first companion. He abandons Nicki for fear of causing him harm and shuns contact with his loved ones."
422,The Tale of the Body Thief,"At the beginning of the story, Lestat grows depressed and becomes remorseful because of his vampiric nature. The ""coven"" of vampires formed at the end of The Queen of the Damned has long since broken up. Among his only remaining friends is the mortal head of the Talamasca Caste, David Talbot. A mysterious figure, Raglan James - the eponymous ""Body Thief"" of the book - offers to trade bodies with Lest at the suggestion of other vampires. However, James has no intention of ever switching back, and Lestsat is forced to scheme to regain his body. LestAt nearly dies after becoming human again - his new body is wracked by pneumonia, which he ignores during a tour of Washington D.C. in the middle of winter. He is saved by the care of a nun named Gretchen. He enjoys a short love affair with Gretchen before she returns to South America, where she works in a convent. He returns to New Orleans, reunites with Louis and begins to renovate his old house in the French Quarter. Above all, he claims that he has finally come to accept his vampsic nature, before dying in his current body. At this point, Tale of the Body Thief reaches a false ending - James is beginning to enjoy life in his new, young body. He now wants to become a vampire, despite his earlier protestations, while taking his friend's blood, while forced to take out his own body instead of returning to his own. The blow proves fatal - the death of James' current body prevents him from leaving the dying body or leaving the current one or leaving his current one.

423,Memnoch the Devil,"The novel follows up on claims made by David Talbot in The Tale of the Body Thief that God and the Devil are on better terms than most Christians believe. It also reinterprets biblical stories to create a complete history of Earth, Heaven and Hell that fit neatly with the history of vampires given in The Queen of the Damned. Although the novel fits into the storyline of The Vampire Chronicles, the vast majority of it consists of Memnoch's account of cosmology and theology. Lestat loses control of himself and Maharet is forced to chain him in the basement of the St. Elizabeth's convent, which is owned by the vampires, so that he will not hurt himself or others. At the end of the novel, Lest at and David go to New Orleans. There, Maharet returns LestAt's eye to him, along with a note from MemnoCh that reveals Memno ch may have been manipulating Lestet to serve his own agenda. Lestsat is left in confusion, unable to decide whether or not to cast his lot with the Devil. He believes that he has seen Christ's crucifixion. He has also lost an eye in Hell. Dora and Armand are deeply moved upon seeing the veil. Armand goes into the sunlight and immolates himself in order to convince people that a miracle has occurred. He tells his story to Armand, David and Dora, who have joined him in New York. D Nora takes it and reveals it to the world, triggering a religious movement. Lets Armand immolate himself in the sunlight in order for people to believe in the miracle that has occurred, and then Dora takes the veil and shows it to people in the daylight. LESTat believes himself to have had a major revelation. He also believes he has received Saint Veronica's Veil. He is also left in a state of confusion and is unable to make a decision about whether to join him as God's adversary or God's servant. He eventually decides to join the Devil, who claims he is not evil, but merely working for God by ushering lost souls into Heaven. The novel was released on September 14, 2013.

424,The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,"Crusoe was married in England and had three children. After losing his wife, he decided to go to ""his island"" Crusoe and Friday left England in January 1694. They arrived at Crusoe's Island via Ireland. They discovered that the English mutineers left on the island by Crusoe a decade earlier had been making trouble, but that when the island fell under attack by cannibals the various parties on the Island were forced to work together under truce to meet the threat. Crusoe takes various steps to consolidate leadership on. the island and assure the civility of the inhabitants, including leaving a quantity of needed supplies. He also sets up a sort of rule of law under an honour system and ensuring cohabitating couples are married. On the way to the mainland once again from Crusoe’s island, the ship is attacked by the cannibal. Friday dies from three arrow shots during an attempt to negotiate, but the crew eventually wins the encounter without further serious casualty. After having buried Friday in the ocean, the same evening they set sail for Brazil. They stayed for a long period there, then went directly over to the Cape of Good Hope. They landed on Madagascar where their nine men were pursued by three hundred natives, because one of his mariners had carried off a young native girl among the trees. They went to the river of Cambodia and Cochin-China or the bay of Tonquin, until they came to the latitude of 22 degrees and 30 minutes, and anchored at the island of Formosa (Taiwan). Then they arrived to the coast of China. Then they travelled through the following places: Changu, Naum (or Naun, a fortified city), Argun(a) on the Chinese-Russian border (April 13, 1703). They passed a little river called Kirtza, near Ozomoys (or Gzomoys), came to Veuslima (?) on the river Witzogda (Vychegda), running into the Dwina, then they stayed in Lawrenskoy (July 3–7, 1704; Yerenskoy Gorodok at that time). Finally Crusoe arrived at Hamburg, sailed into Hamburg and sailed into the White Sea on August 18, 1705. He arrived at London on 10 January 1705, having been gone from England and ten years and ten months from England. He had been there for nine years and nine months."
425,"The 120 Days of Sodom, or the School of Libertinism","The 120 Days Of Sodom is not a complete novel. Only the first section is written in detail. After that, the remaining three parts are written as a draft, in note form, with Sade's footnotes to himself still present in most translations. Four wealthy libertines lock themselves in a castle, the Château de Silling, along with a number of victims and accomplices. They intend to listen to various tales of depravity from four veteran prostitutes, which will inspire them to engage in similar activities with their victims. Sade glorifies as well as vilifies the four main protagonists, alternately declaring them freethinking heroes and debased villains, often in the same passage. The story does portray some black humor, and Sade seems almost lighthearted in his introduction, referring to the reader as ""friend reader"". In this introduction he contradicts himself, at one point insisting that one should not be horrified by the 600 passions outlined in the story because everybody has their own tastes. But at the same time he goes out of his way to warn the reader of the horrors that lay ahead, suggesting that the reader should have doubts about continuing. It is not set at any specific point in time, although it is implied at the start that the events in the book take place either during or shortly after the Thirty Years' War, which lasted from 1618 to 1648. The novel takes place over five months, November to March, and is set in a remote medieval castle, high in the mountains and surrounded by forests, detached from the rest of the world. The description of Silling matches de Sade’s own castle,. the Ch teau de Lacoste. It was written by Sade in 1648, but he decided he would not be able to complete it in full and elected to write out the remaining three-quarters in brief and finish it later. The book is now considered one of the most important works of French literature. It has been translated into more than 20 languages, including English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish, and has been called a masterpiece. The 120 Days of Sodom was published in 1649. It was written by de Sades, who died in Paris in 1650. The author was known as ""Sade"" until the end of his life, when he was forced to retire due to ill-health. He died in 1701."
426,War and Peace,"War and Peace has a large cast of characters, the majority of whom are introduced in the first book. Some are actual historical figures, such as Napoleon and Alexander I. While the scope of the novel is vast, it is centered around five aristocratic families. The plot and the interactions of the characters take place in the era surrounding the 1812 French invasion of Russia during the Napoleonic wars. The novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soirée given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer — the maid of honour and confidante to the queen mother Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters in the novel are introduced as they enter Anna Pav Lovna's salon. The second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war preparations. Book Two begins with Nikolai Rostov briefly returning on home leave to Moscow. He spends an eventful winter at home, accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from the Pavlograd Regiment in which he serves. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young girl. Denis falls in love with her and proposes marriage, but Nikolai refuses to accede to his mother's request. He promises to marry his childhood sweetheart, Sonya Bezukhov, despite knowing it is wrong. He is rationally attracted to the richest and most eligible bachelor in the Russian Empire, Hélène Kuragin, whom he is rams into marriage with. Despite rationally knowing that he is wrong, he is convinced it is the right thing to do. He meets Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, the charming society favourite. He makes the fateful choice to be an aide-de-camp to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war against Napoleon. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov. He befriends the ruthless, and perhaps, psychopathic Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov. The Rostov family are introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov has four adolescent children. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage in a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) is nine and the youngest of the Rostov families; like his brother, is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age."

429,Son Excellence Eugène Rougon,"The novel opens in 1857 with Rougon's career at a low ebb. His greatest ally and his greatest adversary is Clorinde Balbi, an Italian woman of dubious background and devious intent. Rougon refuses to marry her because he believes two such dominant personalities would inevitably destroy each other. Instead, he encourages her to marry M. Delestang, a man of great wealth who can easily be wheedled, while he himself takes a respectable nonentity of a wife who will not hinder his ambition. The novel ends in 1862. The Emperor has returned Rougon to service as Minister without Portfolio, giving him unprecedented powers in the wake of Italian unification.

433,Jack of Shadows,"The novel is set in a world that is tidally locked. One side of the planet is always in light, and the other in darkness. Science rules on the dayside, while magic holds sway in the night. Jack of Shadows (a.k.a. Shadowjack) is unique among the magical beings in that he draws his power not from a physical location but from shadow itself. The novel ends with Jack falling, perhaps to his death, but Morningstar has been freed by the world's turning and rushes to rescue him. The fate of this ambiguous hero is left untold, with Jack wondering, as he falls, if Morningstar will reach him in time. The Key itself and the consequences of its use parallel Jack's progress in his own endeavors. Ultimately, the Key will be responsible for Jack's salvation and his doom. This makes him unbeatable, but not all-powerful. He seeks the advice of Morningstar, who advises him to destroy The Machine at the Heart of the World, which maintains the world’s stability, and set it rotating. He gets access to a computer and uses it to recover Kolwynia. This gives him new powers, but he is unable to rule the world as he once did. He is nearly incapacitated in complete light or complete darkness, but given access to even a small area of shadow, his potency is unmatched. Fleeing the dark side, Jack gets access into the light side. He uses this access to get back to the night side, where he is able to rule as he pleases. He makes a mess of ruling with his new powers and is eventually overthrown by Morningstar. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, and is available in hardback and e-book. The first edition of the book was published in May 1998, with a hardback cover priced at $24.99. The second edition was released in May 1999, with prices starting at $16.99 and the second edition at $19.99 each. The third and fourth editions will be released in June 1998 and July 1998, respectively. The fourth and fifth volumes will be published in September 1998 and October 1998. The fifth and sixth volumes are expected to be released later in the year. The sixth and seventh volumes are scheduled for release in October 1998 and September 1999. The seventh and eighth volumes are due in November 1998, and October 1999, respectively, and will be entitled ""The Key That Was Lost"" by Simon and Schuster."
434,Whose Body?,"Wimsey's mother, the Dowager Duchess of Denver, telephones to say that Thipps, an architect hired to do some work on her local church, has just found a dead body. Sir Reuben Levy, a famous financier, has disappeared from his own bedroom, and there has been a flurry of trading in some Peruvian oil shares. Wimsey becomes convinced that the two are linked. The trail leads to the teaching hospital near the architect's flat, and to surgeon and neurologist Sir Julian Freke, who is based there. He attempts to murder both Parker and Wimsey, and finally tries suicide when his actions are discovered, but is arrested in time. The book establishes many of Wimsey's character traits - for example, his interest in rare books, and his nervous problems associated with his wartime shell-shock. It also introduces many characters who recur in later novels, such as Parker, Bunter, Sugg, and the Dowage Duchess. Whose Body? is now in the public domain in the United States, but may still be copyrighted elsewhere. There is a passing reference in the book to Freddy Arbuthnot, Wimsey’s friend and contact for the stock market, being in love with Sir Reuben Levy's daughter Rachel and wanting to marry her. This theme is picked up in Strong Poison, taking place seven years later, when Freddy at last manages to convince Rachel's family to consent to the match despite his being a gentile - after Freddy compared his long wait with that of the Biblical Jacob for his Rachel. The pauper's body, washed, shaved and manicured, was then carried over the roofs and dumped in Thipp's' bath as a joke. He also tried to murder Wimsey and his friend, Inspector Parker, but was stopped by the police. This is the story of how Freddy finally managed to convince the family of Rachel's father to allow him to marry his daughter, despite being a Gentile. The story is told in the novel's final chapter, in which Freddy finally persuades the family to agree to the marriage. The novel is published by Hodder & Stoughton, priced £16.99, and is available in hardback, paperback and e-book.

435,Clouds of Witness,"Lord Peter Wimsey goes on an extended holiday in Corsica. He receives the news that his sister Mary's fiancé, Captain Denis Cathcart, has been found shot dead outside the Wimseys' shooting lodge at Riddlesdale in Yorkshire. His brother, Gerald, Duke of Denver, is arrested for the murder. Cathcart was killed by a bullet from Denver's revolver, and Denver's only alibi is that he was out for a walk at the time Cathcart died. Peter and his close friend, Inspector Charles Parker, investigate the grounds, and find several tantalizing clues: footprints belonging to a strange man, motorcycle tracks outside the grounds and a piece of jewellery, a lucky charm in the shape of a cat. They also agree that both Gerald and Mary are hiding something; Gerald stubbornly refuses to budge from his story, and Mary is faking a severe illness to avoid talking to anyone. Eventually, the jewelled cat leads Wimsey to Cathcart's mistress of many years, who had left him for an American millionaire. Wimsey travels to New York to find her, and makes a trans-Atlantic flight to return to London before Gerald's trial in the House of Lords ends. From her, Wimsey brings a letter that Cathcart wrote on the night of his death, after receiving her farewell letter. In it, Cathcart announces his intention to commit suicide. He took Gerald's revolver from the study, went out into the garden and shot himself, though he lived long enough to crawl back to the house. While investigating the surrounding countryside Peter meets a violent, homicidal farmer, Mr. Grimethorpe, with a stunningly beautiful wife. He seems a likely killer, but while investigating his alibi (and nearly being killed by stumbling into a bog pit), Peter confirms that GrimethOrpe was elsewhere on the fatal night. He discovers Gerald's letter from his friend in Egypt wedged in the window of the Grimeth orpe's bedroom, proving that Gerald was visiting Grimeth Orpe's wife. Gerald is acquitted. As he is leaving the house to meet his wife, Grimetholpe appears and shoots at him, then panics and flees, and dies. In the final scene, Inspector Sugg, last seen in Whose Body?, is startled to find all the lords celebrating the end of the case on the street after midnight, all drunk as all cabs cabs have been celebrating the start of the investigation."
436,Unnatural Death,"Wimsey discovers that the patient's great-niece - popular locally - had nursed her through her illness and was the intended heiress. The patient had a horror of contemplating death, however, and refused to listen to entreaties that she must make a will. When Wimsey begins investigating, using the recurring character Miss Climpson as his intelligence agent, the great-Niece is provoked into covering her trail. She kills a former servant, fakes a kidnap-murder and tries to frame a distant relative with an interest in the Dawson estate, and almost kills Miss Clim Simpson. She is eventually arrested and imprisoned on remand, where she commits suicide. The doctor from whom Lord Peter originally heard the anecdote has moved on and is not grateful to be vindicated. The film is based on a true story by the same name, and is directed by David Lean. It is available on DVD and Blu-ray.

437,The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club,"General Fentiman has been estranged from his sister, Lady Dormer, for years. On her deathbed, he learns the terms of her will. If she dies first he will inherit a fortune, which his grandsons sorely need. But if he dies first, nearly all of the money will go to Ann Dorland, a distant relative of her late husband. That afternoon the General is found dead in his armchair at the club. The General was poisoned with an overdose of heart medication. Suspicion falls on the last person to see the General, who was among the last persons to see his sister and has an obvious motive to compromise with the General. The only person who agrees to compromise is the General's younger grandson, George FENTiman, a veteran of World War I still suffering from the effects of poison gas and shell shock. In the meantime, Wimsey has had the General exhumed and properly examined and discovered that the General had died on Remembrance Day at 10:37 AM. The next day, Robert found his grandfather dead in the club's library, apparently of natural causes. Piqued at losing the inheritance, he concealed the body overnight in theClub's telephone booth. Wimsey is asked to help solve the puzzle by his friend Mr Murbles, the solicitor for theFentiman family. He agrees, though he insists that he will pursue the exact truth, regardless of who benefits. He also turns up a few clues - there was a fresh tear in the General’s trouser cuff and a scraping of paint on the side of his shoe. There is another sighting of Oliver, and this time Robert and the detectives follow him to Italy. Robert returns from Italy, and admits that Oliver does not exist. He has figured out what happened. There was no memorial poppy on the general's suitcoat - impossible if he had been on the streets on Remem remembrance Day. He had just told Robert the Terms of LadyDormer's will. He was found later that day at the Bellona Club, shortly after seeing his sister. It would seem obvious that he must have died sometime after arriving at theClub on the morning of 11 November. But nobody saw him arrive. But the General went to the club at some point after visiting his sister the previous afternoon, but his whereabouts are unknown between those two events. He went to see Dr Penberthy in between, and then, en route, he had the taxi pick up George Fentimans."
438,Strong Poison,"Mystery author Harriet Vane has been accused of the murder of her former lover, Phillip Boyes. Boyes was a novelist and essayist who wrote in support of atheism, anarchy, and free love. He persuaded a reluctant Harriet to live with him against her principles and they led a Bohemian life in the London art community. A year later he proposed, and Harriet, outraged at being deceived into giving up her public honour, broke off the relationship. Harriet is tried, but the result is a ""hung"" jury, thanks in no small part to the presence of Wimsey's aide, Miss Climpson, on the jury. With fewer than ten of the jury agreeing on a verdict, the judge must order a fresh trial to be held. Wimsey visits Harriet in prison, declares his conviction of her innocence, and promises to catch the real murderer. At her retrial the prosecution presents no case and Harriet is set free. Exhausted by her ordeal, she again rejects Wimsey’s proposal of marriage. It is also in this novel that Peter finally persuades Parker to propose to Peter's sister, Mary. Also the Honourable Freddy Aruthnot, the daughter of Sir Reuben Levy who was murdered in Whose Body? finds a long-delayed domestic bliss with Rachel, the wife of Sir Sir Re-bayed Levy, who was also murdered in.

439,Five Red Herrings,"The story is set in Galloway, a part of Scotland popular with artists because of its landscapes. Sandy Campbell is a talented painter, but also a notoriously quarrelsome drunkard. When he is found dead in a stream, with a half-finished painting on the bank above, it is assumed at first that he fell in accidentally, fracturing his skull. Lord Peter Wimsey, who is in the region on a fishing holiday, points out the inconsistency which makes it impossible for Campbell himself to have worked on the painting. Campbell's death is now a murder case. Whoever killed Campbell also executed the painting in Campbell's distinctive style, to contrive the appearance of an accident. Six other artists in the area are talented enough to have achieved this, and had also had public brawls with Campbell in the recent past. Wimsey has to figure out ""who done it"" and who the five red herrings are. The killer finally realises that the case against him is unbreakable and confesses, but pleads that he killed Campbell in self-defence. When the case is tried, the jury decide that he is guilty of manslaughter (which carries a lighter sentence) rather than premeditated murder. The plot is told through the viewpoint of Wimsey and of the various police investigating the case (including Wimsey's brother-in-law Charles Parker, involved because a suspect is in hiding in London). Large parts of the book follow the various Scottish police officers, who are shown as highly intelligent and competent, and for time seem to overshadow Wimsey. In contrast, Bunter (Wimsey's valet) plays a smaller role in this than in other Wimsey novels. There is only a closed circle of suspects to deal with, and Wimsey have no emotional involvement, although, having alerted the Police to Campbell's murder, he subsequently reflects that Campbell was a man anyone might feel justified in killing. He nevertheless resolves to uncover the truth, so that the five innocent artists should not live under lifelong suspicion. In one episode a character angrily accuses him of ""entering people's homes as a police spy"". The six suspects are all eventually traced and give statements in which they deny killing Campbell. Some have convincing alibis, but others have none which can be verified. Finally, Wimsey offers to reconstruct the crime and over the course of twenty-four hours' strenuous activity, he demonstrates how the killer contrived the scene above the stream and established an alibi. The police put forward several theories implicating all of the suspects either as the killer or as accessories."
440,Have His Carcase,"Harriet Vane and Wimsey are on a hiking holiday after her acquittal on murder charges in Strong Poison. They find the body of a man, with his throat cut and the blood still liquid, on an isolated rock on the shore. The dead man, Paul Alexis, was of Russian extraction and engaged to a rich older widow. The romantic Alexis believed himself a descendant of Russian royalty, and the widow's rather stupid son, appalled at the prospect of his mother's remarriage to a gigolo, conspired with a friend and his wife to play on Alexis's fantasies. Alexis was lured to the rock and murdered by the son, who rode a horse along the beach through the incoming tide to avoid leaving tracks, whilst his friends supplied his alibi. The death was intended to look like suicide. However, Alexis suffers from haemophilia, and his unclotted blood leads to confusion over the time of death, which eventually assists with the unmasking of the conspirators. The film was directed by David Walliams and is based on a novel by the same name, written by Julian Fellowes and published by Simon & Schuster. For more information on the book, visit www.suspectpoison.co.uk or the publisher's website, which can be contacted on 0203 615 4157 or via their website, www.samuelwalliams.com.

441,The Nine Tailors,"Wimsey helps ring a nine-hour peal of bells overnight after Will Thoday, one of the ringers, is stricken by influenza. The Thorpe family has been blighted for 20 years by the unsolved theft of jewels from a house-guest by the butler, Deacon, and an accomplice, Cranton. Both men were imprisoned, but the jewels were never recovered. At Easter, Sir Henry himself dies and his wife's grave is opened for his burial. A body is found hidden in the grave, mutilated beyond recognition. It is first thought to be the body of a tramp labourer calling himself ""Driver"" who arrived and then vanished just after the New Year. An odd document found in the bell chamber by Hilary Thorpe, SirHenry's daughter, proves to be a cipher. Wimsey assumes the two men did recover the emeralds and Cranton then killed Cobbleigh for them, but cannot prove it. When he decodes the cipher (which requires knowledge of change-ringing) it leads him to theEmeralds, still untouched in their hiding place in the church. He also discovers the Thodays' whereabouts through the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1918 Deacon murdered a warder and escaped from prison. He married bigamously in France and waited several years to return for the emerALDs, which he had hidden before his arrest. In fact Deacon had murdered a soldier and swapped identities with him, making his marriage bigamous and their daughters illegitimate. Will tied Deacon to the bell-chamber, planning to bribe him to leave, but became helpless with Spanish influenza next day. Neither can explain how Deacon died and Will marries Mary again under Archbishop Blomsbury's licence. Both are released and Will returns to Fenchurch St. Paul, under Archbishop's licence, under the alias of ""Paul Taylor"", the tenor (largest) bell in the ring. He goes on to marry Mary after the war, believing her a widow. When Jim's body was discovered, Will assumed Jim had killed Deacon and hid it in the new grave, then left for the sea. When the body was found, he made the body unrecognisable andhid it in a new grave. He assumed that Will had murdered him and waited until the night after Lady Thorpe's funeral on 4 January, made it unrecognisable. He then left the newgrave for the new year. When Will's brother Jim led him to find Deacon's body on 2 January, he left for sea."
442,Busman's Honeymoon,"Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane plan to spend their honeymoon at Talboys, an old farmhouse in Harriet's native Hertfordshire. Arriving late at night, they are surprised to find the house locked up and not prepared for them. They gain access and spend their wedding night there, but next morning they discover the former owner, Noakes, dead in the cellar with head injuries. The quiet honeymoon is ruined as a murder investigation begins and the house fills with policemen, reporters, and brokers' men. The suspects include Noakes's niece, Mrs. Ruddle (his neighbour and cleaning lady), Frank Crutchley, a local garage mechanic and the local police constable, who was his blackmail victim. In a final scene, in which almost the entire cast of characters is gathered in the front room of Talboys - reflecting the novel's origin as a work for the stage, the killer turns out to be Crutchly. He planned to marry Noakes' somewhat elderly niece and get his hands on the money he had left her in his will. He set a booby trap with a weighted plant pot on a chain, which was triggered by the victim opening the radio cabinet after locking up for the night. The house had been locked and bolted when the newly-weds arrived, and medical evidence seems to rule out an accident, so it seems he was attacked in the house and died later, having somehow locked up after his attacker. Wimsey's reaction to the case - his arrangement for the defendant to be represented by top defence counsel; his guilt at condemning a man to be hanged; the return of his shell-shock – dominate the final chapters of the book. It is mentioned that Wimsey had previously also suffered similar pangs of conscience when other murderers had been sent to the gallows. In fact Sayers wrote no further Wimsey novels after this one. The 1942 short story ""Talboys"", the very last Wimsey fiction produced by Sayers, is both a sequel to the present book, in having the same location and some of the same village characters, and an antithesis in being lighthearted and having no crime worse the theft of some peaches from a neighbour's garden. The book ends with Peter's and Harriet's relationship, always complex and painfully negotiated, is resolved during the process of catching the murderer and bringing him to justice. His deep remorse and guilt at having causedCrutchley to be executed leave doubt as to whether he would undertake further murder investigations."
443,"Thrones, Dominations","Lord and Lady Peter Wimsey have just returned from a European honeymoon. They are settling into their new home in London, where daily life is affected by the illness and then death of the king. The couple become slightly acquainted with Laurence Harwell, a wealthy theatrical ""angel"" and his beautiful wife, whom he has rescued from poverty. After two years' marriage the Harwells are famously still devoted to one another. When she is found dead at their weekend cottage in the country Wimsey is asked to help interview the distraught husband. After some plot twists, a second murder and a scene involving the hidden rivers and Victorian sewers that run under London, it is revealed that Harwell unintentionally killed his wife in a jealous rage. He later committed the premeditated murder of an actress who was in a position to disprove his alibi and tried to blackmail him. Harriet visits Harwell in prison to comfort him with the knowledge that his wife had not, after all, been unfaithful. In doing so, she finally banishes the lingering ghosts of her own imprisonment and murder trial, and the effect they have had on her relationship with her own husband. She also discovers she is expecting a baby, and finds a practical solution to allow Wimsey's devoted manservant Bunter to marry without having to leave the household. Harriet's unorthodox approach infuriates her sister-in-law (who believes Harriet has an obligation to abandon her career, do her duty to the family and produce an heir) but it allows her to solve most of the practical difficulties that might have stood in the way of a successful and happy marriage. She is also asked to undertake sensitive diplomatic duties connected with the problematic behaviour of the new king, and as the 1936 abdication crisis looms, he gloomily predicts the coming war with Hitler's Germany. Two men who knew Mrs Harwell's father in prison, and who have been blackmailing him with threats to harm her, are also suspected. Harriet straightens out her domestic situation, learning how to fulfill her new role whilst keeping her own identity. She finds a solution to let Bunter marry without leaving the household, and also finds a way to allow her to have a child with her husband's childhood sweetheart, who is also her best friend. Harriet also discovers that she is pregnant with her first child, who she names after her late father, who was also a playwright. The book ends on a cliffhanger, with Harriet's husband telling her that he will never be able to see her again."
444,Light in August,"The narrative structure consists of three connected plot-strands. Lena Grove is trying to find Lucas Burch, the father of her unborn child. Joe Christmas came to Jefferson three years before the novel's beginning, and got a job at the planing mill. Joanna Burden continues her ancestors' struggle for Black emancipation, which makes her an outsider in Jefferson, much like Christmas. Reverend Gail Hightower is obsessed by the past adventures of his Confederate grandfather, who was killed while stealing chickens from a farmer's shed. The novel leaves readers uncertain whether Joe Christmas or Joe Brown is the murderer. The only character who does not turn his back on the Reverend Hightowers is Byron Bunch, who tries to convince him to give the imprisoned Joe Christmas alibi, but he accepts it too late. In the end, Christmas is seen musing over his past past alone in his house as he prepares for his own death' Before Christmas' escape, he is seen moving into a train and getting into a fight which he loses and gets into a moving train and is moving into his own train. He is leaving Joanna's burning house when a passing farmer stops to investigate and pull her body from the fire. The sheriff at first suspects Joe Brown, but initiates a man-hunt for Christmas after Brown claims that Christmas is black. A zealous national guardsman, Percy Grimm, follows him there and shoots and castrates Joe Christmas. In Mottstown, Christmas arrives undisguised in a neighboring town; he is arrested and jailed, then moved to Jefferson, no longer running. His grandmother visits him in the Jefferson jail and advises him to seek help from GailHightower. In Jefferson, Christmas escapes from police's house and runs to Hightsower's house, but then accepts Byron's suggestion to hide, too late as Percy Grimm is close behind him. When Joe Christmas gets there, Byron arranges for Brown/Burch to come and see her, but when he gets there he runs again, instigating a fight, which he gets into and loses his train and gets moving into the moving train. The narrative of Lena's story builds a framework around the two other plot-Strands. One of these is the story of the enigmatic Joe Christmas, who as a child ran away from his abusive adoptive parents who were conservatively religious. As a result of sexual frustration and the beginning of menopause, Joanna turns to religion. She is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated."

446,Consciousness Explained,"Dennett's view of consciousness is that it is the apparently serial account for the brain's underlying parallelism. One of the book's more controversial claims is that qualia do not (and cannot) exist. Dennett claims that our brains hold only a few salient details about the world, and that this is the only reason we are able to function at all. Research subsequent to Dennett's book indicates that some of his postulations were more conservative than expected. A year after Consciousness Explained was published, Dennett noted ""I wish in retrospect that I'd been more daring, since the effects are stronger than I claimed"". And since then examples continue to accumulate of the illusory nature of our visual world. Also Dennett says that only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of unconscious events could explain consciousness at all: «To explain is to explain away». The book puts forward a ""multiple drafts"" model of consciousness, suggesting that there is no single central place (a ""Cartesian Theater"") where conscious experience occurs. The brain consists of a ""bundle of semi-independent agencies""; when ""content-fixation"" takes place in one of these, its effects may propagate so that it leads to the utterance of one of the sentences that make up the story in which the central character is one's ""self"" Dennett wryly notes that he is committed to the belief that we are all zombies. He also says that ""philosophical zombies"", which are supposed to act like a human in every way while somehow lacking qualia, cannot exist. This approach allows the reports of the subject to be a datum in psychological research, thus circumventing the limits of classical behaviorism. A key philosophical method is heterophenomenology, in which verbal or written reports of subjects are treated as akin to a theorist's fiction. The subject's report is not questioned, but it is not assumed to be an incorrigible report about that subject's inner state. This is not necessary and would consume valuable computing power. Rather, we log what has changed and assume the rest has stayed the same, with the result that we miss some details, as demonstrated in various experiments and illusions, some of which Dennett outlines. In the book Dennett argues that the only way to explain consciousness is to look at unconscious events, which he calls ""theory of unconsciousness"" The book also argues that we need a theory of consciousness that explains unconscious events as well as conscious events."
447,The Clouds,"Faced with legal action for non-payment of debts, Strepsiades enrolls his son in the ""thinkeria"" (the ""Phrontisterion"") so that he might learn the rhetorical skills necessary to defeat their creditors in court. The son thereby learns cynical disrespect for social mores and contempt for authority and he subsequently beats his father up during a domestic argument. In the end, the audience reveals that the school of Inferior Argument is a bugged school of people - people who know how to talk their way out of trouble. At the end of the debate, a quick survey of the audience by the buggers reveals that people with the best education can offer the best of both worlds. The play is set in Athens in the 4th century BC and is set against the backdrop of the Battle of Thermopylae. It is one of the most famous plays of all time and is thought to have been written by Sophocles. It was first performed at the Festival of the Four Seasons in Athens, Greece, in 476 BC. It has been described as the ""greatest play ever written by a Greek author"" and has been called ""one of the best plays ever written in the history of the theatre"" by the University of California, San Diego. The author has also been called the ""father of the playwright"" and ""the father of the drama"" by The New York Review of Books. He has also written a play about the life of Socrates, which was first published in 4th Century BC, called ""Socrates and The Thinkery"" (The Thinkery and The Clouds). He has written a second play about Socrates called ""The Great Debate"" which has been published in 2nd century BC, also by The NY Review. He is also the author of the book about Socrates' life, The Great Debate (The Great Argument, The Clouds, and The Great Debates). The play has been translated into German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Spanish. The composer has said that he was inspired by Socrates to write the play. He also says that the play was written in response to the events of the First World War. The writer has also said that the work was written as a response to events in the aftermath of the Second World War, when the Allies were at war with the Germans, and that he wanted to make a point about the role of the U.S. military in the conflict."
448,The Knights,"The Knights is a satire on political and social life in 5th-century Athens. The characters are drawn from real life and Cleon is clearly intended to be the villain. However it is also an allegory, the characters are figures of fantasy and the villain in this context is Paphlagonian, a comic monstrosity responsible for almost everything that's wrong with the world. This summary features the real-world names Cleon, Nicias and Demosthenes (though these names are never mentioned in the play).

449,Romance of the Three Kingdoms,"In the final years of the Han Dynasty, incompetent eunuchs deceive the emperor and persecute good officials. The government becomes extremely corrupt on all levels, leading to widespread deterioration of the empire. During the reign of the penultimate Han sovereign, Emperor Ling, the Yellow Turban Rebellion breaks out under the leadership of Zhang Jue (a.k.a. Zhang Jiao). The rebellion is barely suppressed by troops under the command of He Jin, General-in-Chief of the imperial armies. In the ensuing chaos, the child Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu disappear from the palace. The missing emperor and prince are found later by soldiers of the warlord Dong Zhuo, who proceeds to seize control of the Imperial capital Luoyang under the pretext of protecting the emperor. Dong later deposes EmperorShao and replaces him with the Prince. Sun Jian finds the Imperial Seal and keeps it secretly for himself, further weakening royal authority. Without a strong central government, warlords begin to rise and fight each other for land, plunging China into a state of anarchy. Many others, even those without title or land, such as Cao Cao and Liu Bei, are also starting to build up power. Cao Cao unites the Central Plains and northern China under his rule, and the lands he controlled would serve as the foundation for the state of Cao Wei in the future. Sun Ce dies at the pinnacle of his career from illness under stress of his terrifying encounter with the ghost of Yu Ji, a venerable magician whom he had falsely accused and executed in jealousy. However, his younger brother Sun Quan, who succeeds him, proves to be a capable and charismatic ruler. Sun, assisted by skilled advisors Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao, inspires hidden talents such as Lu Su to join his service, and builds up a strong military force. Liu Bei becomes the governor of Xu Province after Tao Qian passes on the post to him. While Cao Cao subtly reveals his intention to usurp power, Liu Bei is officially recognised by the Emperor Xian as a saviour and seen as a defector. However Liu Bei's ambitions are not realized until the later part of the novel, when he joins in defeating Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi. They join the campaign against Dong Zuo and participate in a campaign against Gongsun Zan and join the battle against Dong. They are not recognized for his efforts in quelling the YellowTurban Rebellion and appointed as junior magistrate."
450,The Dragon in the Sea,"Set in a near-future earth, the West and the East have been at war for more than a decade. The West is stealing oil from the East with specialized nuclear submarines. The suspicion is that sleepers are sabotaging the subs or revealing their positions once at sea. John Ramsey, a young psychologist, is trained as an electronics operator and sent on the next mission, replacing the previous officer who went insane. His secret mission is to find the sleeper, or figure out why the crews are going insane. The last twenty submarines have simply disappeared, with the suspicion that they have been sabotaged or reveal their positions.

451,Destination: Void,"In the future, humankind has tried to develop artificial intelligence, succeeding only once, and then disastrously. The current project is being run on the moon, and the book tells the story of the seventh attempt in a series of experiments to create an artificial consciousness. For each attempt the scientists raise a group of clones. These clones are kept isolated and raised to believe that they will be the crew of a spaceship that will colonize a planet in the Tau Ceti solar system. The crew are just caretakers: the ship is controlled by a disembodied human brain, called ""Organic Mental Core"" or ""OMC"" that runs the complex operations of the vessel and keeps it moving in space. But the first two OMC's (Myrtle and Little Joe) become catatonic, while the third OMC goes insane and kills two of the umbilicus crew members. The ship carries thousands of other clones in hibernation, intended to populate the new colony and, if necessary, provide replacements for any crew members who die along the way. Space Ship Earthling number Seven ultimately succeeds. The consequences of their success form the basis of the plot for the novels which follow. fr: Destination vide he:Destination: Void. He understands the nature of the test: create a high pressure environment in which brilliance may break through out of necessity, and create in the safety of the void what humans couldn't safely create on Earth. He is aware that six other ships have gone out before theirs, each one failing. He's aware that the breakdown of the ""OMM""s was planned. He knows that if they attempt to turn back they would be ordered to abort (self destruct) The crew knows that the ship will take hundreds of years to reach the system and the crew will spend most of their time in hibernating. The clones have been bred and carefully selected for psychological purposes to reinforce each other, as well as to provide various specialized skills that will give them the best chance of success. They know that the crew includes a chaplain-psychiatrist, Raja Flattery, who knows their real purpose, and that the break-down of the OMCs is planned. The captain of the ship knows that he will be killed if he tries to abort the mission. He can't turn back, so he decides to go through with the mission, even though he knows it will be a waste of his life and his life will be destroyed."
452,Whipping Star,"In Whipping Star, Jorj X. McKie is a saboteur extraordinary, a born troublemaker who has naturally become one of BuSab's best agents. As the novel opens, it is revealed that Calebans, who are beings visible to other sentient species as stars, have been disappearing one by one. Each disappearance is accompanied by millions of sentient deaths and instances of incurable insanity. When the Caleban dies, everyone who has ever used a jumpdoor (which is almost every adult in the sentient world and many of the young) will die as well. The Calebans begin to disappear one at a time, leaving our plane of existence (or exiting ""our wave"") to save themselves. As all Calebans are connected, if all were to remain in our existence, when Fannie Mae died, all Caleans would die. As each Calean exits, millions of the ConSentiency are killed or rendered insane. The Bureau of Sabotage (BuSab) is created to slow the wheels of government, thereby preventing it from legislating recklessly. Mliss Abnethe, a psychotic human female with immense power and wealth, has bound a Calesan in a contract that allows the Calesans to be whipped to death. McKIE has to find MlISS and stop her before Fannie Rae reaches, in her words, ""ultimate discontinuity"" But he is constrained by the law protecting private individuals by restricting the ministrations of Bu Sab to public entities. McKies succeeds in saving Fannie. Mae by opening a. jumpdoor into space which shunts a large interstellar cloud of (presumably) hydrogen into her stellar body, rejuvenating her from her torture at the hands of the Palenki henchmen hired by M liss Ab nethe. The novel is set in the far future, when humankind has made contact with numerous other species: Gowachin, Laclac, Wreaves, Pan Spechi, Taprisiots, and Calesban (among others) and has helped to form the Con Sentiency to govern among the species. Ninety years prior to the setting of Whipping. Star, the Calebans appeared and offered jumpdoors to the collective species, allowing sentients to travel instantly to any point in the universe. Gratefully accepting, the sentiency didn't question the consequences. The sentients of the galaxy found the need for a Bureau ofSabotage."
453,The Dosadi Experiment,"The novel is set in a distant future when humans are part of an interstellar civilization called the ConSentiency composed of many species. A secret, unauthorized experiment by the Gowachins was carried out with the help of a contract with the Calebans. They isolated the planet Dosadi behind an impenetrable barrier called ""The God Wall"". On the planet were placed humans and Gowachin, with an odd mix of modern and old technology. The culture of ordinary day to day power in Dosadi is very violent. Among other tools, addictive psychotropes are used for handling power among hierarchies in organisations. Senior Liator Keila Jedrik starts a war that will change Dosadi forever. Jorj X. McKie is a Saboteur Extraordinary, one of the principals of the Bureau of Sabotage, and the only human admitted to practice law before the Gowchin bar as a legum (lawyer). While meditating in a park in BuSab headquarters McKie. is mentally contacted by the Caleban Fannie Mae, a female member of a species of unparalleled power from another dimension whose visible manifestation in this universe is the star Thyone in the Pleiades cluster. This gives them the ability to swap bodies and thus by using a hole in the contract sealing Dosadi they can escape via jump gate. Once free, by legal manoeuvring the Dosadi population is unleashed upon the Con Sentiency for good or ill, whilst the people who set the project in motion try to deal with the consequences, having sent McKie there hoping a solution more in their interest could be found. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback, paperback and e-book.

454,The Transparent Society,"Brin argues that a core level of privacy - protecting our most intimate interactions - may be preserved, despite the rapid proliferation of cameras. He feels that this core privacy can be saved simply because that is what humans deeply need and want. Brin: Privacy is only possible if freedom (including the freedom to know) is protected first. He argues that it will be good for society if the powers of surveillance are shared with the citizenry, allowing ""sousveillance"" or ""viewing from below,"" enabling the public to watch the watchers. It will be tempting to pass laws that restrict the power of surveillance to authorities, entrusting them to protect our privacy -- or a comforting illusion of privacy. By contrast, a transparent society destroys that illusion by offering everyone access to the vast majority of information out there, Brin says. He admits that such a mostly-open world will seem more irksome and demanding; people will be expected to keep negotiating the tradeoffs between knowing and privacy. It is the only condition under which citizens may have some chance of catching the violators of their freedom and privacy, says Brin. He says there is no power-equalizer greater than knowledge, and that privacy is a ""contingent right,"" one that grows out of the more primary rights, e.g. to know and to speak. The key question is whether citizens will be potent, sovereign and knowing enough to enforce this deeply human want, he says. This means they must not only have rights, but also the power to use them and the ability to detect when they are being abused, he adds. It's the same trend promoted by Adam Smith, John Locke, the US Constitutionalists and the western enlightenment, who held that any elite (whether commercial, governmental, or aristocratic) should experience constraints upon its power. According to Brin, that will only happen in a world that is mostly open, in which most citizens know most of what is going on, most of the time. The only way to protect privacy is to be open and honest about what you are doing, he argues, and to share your information with the public in a way that is open and transparent. The idea is to make it easier for people to make informed decisions about what they want to do and what to do with their lives, and not just rely on the help of others to tell them what is happening to them. The goal is to create a society that is more free and open."
455,The Poisoned Chocolates Case,"Sir Eustace Pennefather is a known womanizer whose divorce from his current wife is pending. He receives a complimentary box of chocolates through the post. A few hours later Joan Bendix is dead, whereas her husband, who has eaten far less of the chocolate, is taken seriously ill and hospitalized (but later recovers) The police can establish a few facts beyond any doubt: that the parcel was posted the previous evening near The Strand; that the poison that was injected into each of the chocolate is nitrobenzene; and that the accompanying letter was typewritten on a piece of stationery from the manufacturers. At the very end of the novel, however, there is no doubt as to the identity of the perpetrator. The murderer seems to feel safe with no need to cover up their tracks any further. The members of Roger Sheringham's Crimes Circle go about individually solving the case. After a week has passed, they present their findings on consecutive nights to their colleagues. Not surprisingly, they come up with various suspects: Sir EustACE's estranged wife; the father of a young lady whom Sir Eastace intended to marry after his divorce got through; one of Sir Estace's discarded mistresses; and some more. While these discussions are going on, the murderer appears to feelsafe with noneed to coverup their tracks. The author has no intention of giving up on the mystery of the poisoned box of chocolate and the mystery will only get worse as time goes on. The book is published by Simon & Schuster and is available in hardback and e-book.

456,Oedipus at Colonus,"Oedipus kills his father and marries his mother. He is told by an oracle that the outcome of the conflict will depend on where he is buried. He asks to see the king of Athens, who sympathizes with him and offers him his burial site, which will ensure victory in a future conflict with Thebes. The chorus sings about the glory and beauty of Athens. The king of Thebes threatens to use force to bring OedipUS back to Thebes, who calls for Poseidon to condemn Creon, telling him, ""I knew [your city] would never harbor a father-killer... so exposed as the mate of his own mother"" The chorus then calls for OedIPus to come from Thebes to sacrifice to Poseidon, who comes from a city that practices nothing without law. The play ends with the chorus singing about the beauty and glory of Athens and the glory of Poseidon's love for his wife, Antigone, and their children, Eteocles, Ismene and Polyneices, and Oedipsus and his daughters, Laius and Agamemnon. It was first performed at the Theatre of the Clouds in Athens in 4th century BC, and is considered one of the best-known plays of all time. It is now considered to be the most famous play in the history of the ancient Greek drama, along with Sophocles's ""The Idiot's Guide to the End of the World"" and ""The Marriage of Aphrodite and Psyche"" The play is set in the city of Colonus, Greece, during the time of the Trojan War. The plot involves the death of Oedippus' father and the burial of his mother in a place sacred to the Furies, or Erinyes. The story is told in the form of a play by Sophocleus and is written in the first person by Euripides, who is also the author of the play's libretto, ""The Death and Arrival of Laiu"" (4th Century BC) The play also includes the story of the birth of the first son, Theseus, and the birth and death of Theseus' daughter, IsMene. The final scene is set during the reign of the king Theseus in the year 476 BC, in which he is crowned king of the Athens and is given the title of ""King of Athens"" by the people of the city."
457,Vurt,"Vurt tells the story of Scribble and his ""gang"", the Stash Riders, as they search for his missing sister/lover Desdemona. The novel is set in an alternate version of Manchester, England, in which society has been shaped by Vurt, a hallucinogenic drug/shared alternate reality, accessed by sucking on colour-coded feathers. Through some (never explained) mechanism, the dreams, mythology, and imaginings of humanity have achieved objective reality in the Vurt and become ""real"" Before the novel begins, Scribbles and his sister-lover take a shared trip into a vurt called English Voodoo, but upon awakening Scribble finds his sister has been replaced by an amorphous blob that Mandy, a fellow Stash Rider, nicknames ""The Thing from Outer Space"" From that point on, Scribble is on a mission to find another copy of the rare and contraband Curious Yellow feather so that he can exchange The Thing for Desdemonia. The Thing from outer space is a rare and rare Curious Yellow Feather, which can only be obtained by sucking a particular colour of Vurt feather. The Curious Yellow feathers are found in Vurt in a variety of ways, including by sucking them from different colours of the drug, such as red, blue, and yellow.

458,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,"Schlosser describes the evolution of fast food and how it has coincided with the advent of the automobile. He explains how the McDonald's Corporation modeled its marketing tactics on The Walt Disney Company, which inspired the creation of advertising icons such as Ronald McDonald and his sidekicks. Schlosser concludes that, given the swift, decisive and effective action that took place as a result of this interest and intervention, many of the problems documented in the book are solvable, given enough political will. A later section of the book discusses the fast food industry's role in globalization, linking increased obesity in China and Japan with the arrival ofFast food. The book also includes a summary of the McLibel Case. In later editions, Schlossers provided an additional section that included reviews of his book, counters to critics who emerged since its first edition, and discussion of the effect that the threat of BSE had on US Federal Government policy towards cattle farming. In the U.S., 80% of sponsored textbooks contain material that is biased in favor of the sponsors, and 30% of high schools offer fast foods in their cafeterias. In his examination of the meat packing industry, Sch Losser finds that it is now dominated by casual, easily exploited immigrant labor and that levels of injury are among the highest of any occupation in the United States. He notes that practices like these were responsible for the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, aka Mad Cow Disease, p. 202-3), as well as for introducing harmful bacteria into the food supply, such as E. coli O157:H7 (ch. 9, ""What's In The Meat""). Schlosseser also recounts the steps involved in meat processing and reveals several hazardous practices unknown to many consumers. He discusses his findings on meat packing companies IBP, Inc. and on Kenny Dobbins. He sees that reductions in corporate taxation have come at the expense of school funding, thereby presenting many corporations with the opportunity for sponsorship with those same schools. According to his sources, 80 per cent of sponsored books are biased against the sponsors of the schools they sponsor. He concludes that many of these problems can be solved with political will and swift and decisive action by the federal government. He also discusses the tactic's ills: the exploitation of children's naïveté and trusting nature, and that the tactic would instill brand loyalty that would persist through adulthood through nostalgic associations to McDonald's. He suggests that if the worst were to happen and the entire base were entombed in the mountain, anthropologists of the future would discover random fast food wrappers scattered amongst military hardware."
459,The Dice Man,"The book tells the story of a psychiatrist named Luke Rhinehart who, feeling bored and unfulfilled in life, starts making decisions about what to do based on a roll of a dice. Along the way, there is sex, rape, murder, ""dice parties"", breakouts by psychiatric patients, and various corporate and governmental machines being put into a spin. There is also a description of the cult that starts to develop around the man, and the psychological research he initiates, such as the ""Fuck without Fear for Fun and Profit"" program. The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced at $24.99.

460,The Search for the Dice Man,"The book is set 20 years after the end of The Dice Man. Larry Rhinehart has grown up to become a hotshot investor on the stock market. He gets approached by the FBI, who are trying to trace his father's location, and find out whether he's alive or dead. Larry naturally refuses to have anything to do with the FBI. He soon starts to pursue his own investigations. Along the way, what he sees and hears change his views somewhat. By the end it is he who is trying to convince Luke, his father, to accept more chance into his life, rather than the other way round. He is financed in this by his fiancée's father, who wants to put the whole dice business to rest. It takes a long time - a whole book in fact, but Larry eventually does complete his quest.

461,Anna Karenina,"The novel is divided into eight parts. Its epigraph is Vengeance is mine, I will repay, from Romans 12:19, which in turn is quoting from Deuteronomy 32:35. The novel opens with a scene introducing Prince Stepan Arkadyevitch Oblonsky (""Stiva""), a Moscow aristocrat and civil servant who has been unfaithful to his wife Darya Alexandrovna, (""Dolly""). Stiva's childhood friend, Konstantin Dmitrievich Levin (""Kostya""), arrives in Moscow with the aim of proposing to Dolly's youngest sister, Princess Katerina Alexandrovne Shcherbatskaya (""Kitty"") Levin discovers that Kitty is also being pursued by Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky, an army officer. At the ball, Vronski dances with Anna, choosing her as a partner over a shocked and heartbroken Kitty. Anna, shaken by her emotional and physical response to Vronssky, returns at once to Saint Petersburg. During the overnight journey, the two meet and Vronsky confesses his love. Anna refuses him, although she is deeply affected by his attentions to her. Although she initially tries to reject him, she eventually succumbs to his attention. Anna returns to her husband Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin, a senior government official, and their son Sergei. On seeing her husband for the first time since her encounter with Vronky, Anna realises that she finds him repulsive. Anna is uneasy about leaving her young son, Seryozha, alone for thefirst time. She also talks openly and emotionally about Stiva’s affair, convincing her that Stiva stills loves her despite the infidelity. Kitty, just eighteen, is in her first season as a debutante and is expected to make an excellent match with a man of her social standing. Kitty is very struck by Anna's beauty and personality, and becomes infatuated with her. When Levin proposes to Kitty at her home, she clumsily turns him down. Levin, crushed by Kitty's refusal, returns to his estate farm, abandoning any hope of marriage. Anna begins to spend more time in Saint Petersburg, spending time with Princess Betsy, a fashionable socialite and Vronskai's cousin. Kitty realises she is suffering because of Vronskys and Levin, whom she had hurt and had hurt in vain. Levin cares for her sister by referring to her infidelity, saying she could never love a man who betrayed her."
462,Adventures of Wim,"Adventures of Wim is a new interpretation of the story of Wim. The book is made up of sections taken from other, fictional books. The preface to the book claims that it was written in Deya, Majorca, in 2326. Wim, also known as ""He of Many Chances"", proves to be an inefficient saviour, as God sends him on a quest for Ultimate Truth. After a long and arduous search, Wim finds ultimate truth (in a tomato), and with it the cure for the sickness of the human condition. He is pronounced to be the saviour of the Montauk nation by his tribe's navigator, and educated in their ways. Sadly, the humans steal him away and attempt to educate him in more useful skills, such as American Football. The screenplay is possibly in there as a result of Luke Rhinehart's continuing frustration in trying to get The Dice Man turned into a good movie. It is a multi-faceted and whimsical account of 'one of the greatest figures in the 20th and 21st Century' The Gospel According to Luke (Luke Forth, not Luke Rhinhart) and the screenplay of a movie. The Book of the Die and Whim: Montauks for ""Wave Rider"" and ""Wim"" (in Adventures of Wim) or ""Whim"" or 'Wim' or 'Whim' (in The Book Of The Die And Whim) is a book about a boy named Wim, who is born of a virgin mother and is named ""wim"" in the book. It was written by Luke Forth, and published by Simon & Schuster in 1994. It has been adapted into a film, which is due to be released later this year, starring Tom Hanks and Amy Adams as well as a host of other actors and actresses. The film will be based on the book, and will be directed by Quentin Tarantino. It will be released in UK cinemas on September 25th, 2014, with a UK release date of September 27th, 2015, and a US release date on September 28th, 2016. The UK release dates for the film are yet to be announced. The U.S. release date for the movie is still to be confirmed, but it is expected to be in time for Christmas 2014. The movie will be filmed in the UK and the U.K. for release on September 29th, and the UK on September 30th, 2017."

465,"Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates","In Holland, poor-but-industrious and honorable 15-year-old Hans Brinker and his younger sister Gretel, yearn to participate in December's great ice-skating race on the canal. Hans' father, Raff Brinker, is sick and amnesiac, with violent episodes, because of a head injury caused by a fall from a dike, and he cannot work. Hans offers his own money, saved in the hope of buying steel skates, to the doctor to pay for his father's operation. Touched by this gesture, Dr. Boekman provides the surgery for free, and Hans is able to buy good skates for both himself and Gretel to skate in the race. Gretel wins the girls' race, but Hans lets a friend — who needs it more — win the precious prize, the Silver Skates, in the boys' race. Mr. Brinker's operation is successful and he is restored to health and memory. The Brinker parents live a long and happy life. Hans goes to medical school and becomes a successful doctor, and his daughter Gretel also grows up to enjoy a happy adult life.

466,Dreamcatcher,"Dreamcatcher is set near the fictional town of Derry, Maine. It is the story of four lifelong friends: Gary Ambrose ""Jonesy"" Jones, Pete Moore, Joe ""Beaver"" Clarendon and Henry Devlin. The friends save Douglas ""Duddits"" Cavell, a young teen with Down syndrome, from a group of sadistic bullies. The four go on a hunting trip together each year, and plan to visit Duddits on their return from this year's trip to the Hole-in-the-Wall. While on the trip, Jonesy finds a disoriented and delirious stranger wandering in the woods during a blizzard, and talking about lights in the sky. The man exhibits dyspepsia and extremely foul flatulence but claims that these are the result of eating berries and lichen while he was lost. Beaver and Jonesy notice large numbers of animals, all with a similar reddish discoloration, migrating. The stampeding animals all have similar symptoms caused by infection with an extraterrestrial macro virus. Eating or inhaling the red mold causes large worm-like aliens, called byrum, to infest the host. The byrum are red, lamprey-like creatures with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth. When an infestation is sufficiently established, the host develops a form of telepathy with other infested individuals. The friend name the byrum ""shit weasel"" because it exits the body through the anus, killing the host, and the friends name it ""The Ripley"" because of its extreme resilience to destruction. Colonel Kurtz states that the Grays have tried several times in the past century to gain control of the earth, but have failed. The Grays are outside a crashed spacecraft, sending messages that they come in peace and are helpless to try to fool the Army. Several helicopters are sent to wipe out the byrus, but they mainly succeed in wiping out the soldiers exposed to the attack. Meanwhile, all people in the area who have been affected by the fungus are rounded up by the Army, with the intention that they will later be executed by the army. The last person to discover this is Beaver, who uses the last of his strength to discover being killed by the last byrum to save his friends from being executed by his last byrus. The story ends with Beaver trapping the trapped creature inside the toilet lid, and falling to the floor, freeing the creature, which then attacks him."

The car, a ""Paragon Panther,"" was the sole production of the Paragon motor-car company before it went bankrupt. After the restoration is complete, the car is named for the noises made by its starter motor and the characteristic two loud backfires it makes when it starts. At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang is just a big and powerful car, but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam on their way to the beach for a picnic. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls a switch which causes it to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road.

470,Oliver Twist,"Orphaned almost from his first breath by his mother's death in childbirth and his father’s unexplained absence. Oliver is meagerly provided for under the terms of the Poor Law and spends the first nine years of his life at a baby farm in the 'care' of a woman named Mrs. Mann. Around the time of Oliver's ninth birthday, Mr. Bumble, a parish beadle, removes Oliver from the baby farm and puts him to work picking oakum at the main workhouse. One day, the desperately hungry boys decide to draw lots; the loser must ask for another portion of gruel. The task falls to Oliver, who at the next meal tremblingly comes forward, bowl in hand, and makes his famous request: ""Please, sir, I want some more."" A great uproar ensues. The board of well-fed gentlemen who administer the workhouse hypocritically offer five pounds to any person wishing to take on the boy as an apprentice. A brutal chimney sweep almost claims Oliver, however, when he begs despairingly not to be sent away with ""that dreadful man"", a kindly old magistrate refuses to sign the indentures. Oliver eventually decides to run away, and, ""He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the hill,"" until a well-placed milestone sets his wandering feet towards London. During his journey to London, Oliver encounters Jack Dawkins, a pickpocket more commonly known by the nickname the ""Artful Dodger"", although Oliver's innocent nature prevents him from recognising this hint that the boy may be dishonest. In this way, Oliver unwittingly falls in with an infamous Jewish criminal known as Fagin, the so-called gentleman of whom the Artful dodger spoke. He believes they make wallets and handkerchiefs because they are of no income. Later, Oliver realises that their real mission is to pickpocket an old gentleman named Charley Brownlow. When he finds his handker Chief missing, he pursues him and takes him to the judge's court. The judge clears the boy of crime, but is reluctant to believe he is a pick pocket. Others join in the chase and Oliver is taken and taken before the magistrate Curiously, Mr Brownlow has second thoughts about the book. The boy is taken to the police and is taken into custody. The book is published in 1837 by Bentley's Miscellany, but when originally published in Bentley's miscellany the town was called Mudfog."
471,East of Eden,"The story is primarily set in the Salinas Valley, California, between the beginning of the 20th century and the end of World War I. Some chapters are in Connecticut and Massachusetts, and the story goes as far back as the American Civil War. Adam Trask's life is seen in a long, intricate flashback. Cathy Ames is described as having a ""malformed soul""; she is cold, cruel, and utterly incapable of feeling for anyone but herself. She leaves home one evening after setting fire to her family's home, killing both of her parents. She renames herself ""Kate"" and embarks on a devious &ndash; and successful plan to ingratiate herself with the owner, murder her and inherit the business. The boys, particularly Aron, are horrified that their father is now a laughingstock in the town of Salinas, laughing at everyone around him and wandering around town late at night. The popular and beloved and beloved Samuel Hamilton finally passes away and is mourned by the boys and their beloved mother. Adam becomes inspired by the memory of Samuel Hamilton's inventiveness and loses all of the family's fortune in an ill-fated business venture. During one night of wandering around the town, Caleb decides to become an Episcopalian priest. He takes on the role of priest and takes the town around him to talk about his human failings, shuns everyone else and takes to the streets at night to talk to people.

He eventually becomes a successful and beloved inventor and farmer, but his life is turned upside down by the death of his father, who left him $50,000 each. He becomes a widower and father to two sons, Caleb and Aron &ndAsh; echoing Cain and Abel &ndASH; who are oblivious of their mother's situation. Adam is so ecstatically happy with his new life that he does not realize there is any problem. Shortly after Cathy gives birth to twin boys, she shoots Adam in the shoulder and flees. Adam recovers, but remains in a deep and terrible depression, but is roused out of it enough to name and raise his sons with the help of his Cantonese cook, Lee, and his neighbor Samuel Hamilton. Lee tells about how his relatives in San Francisco, a group of Chinese scholars, spent two years studying Hebrew so they might discover what the moral of the Cain & Abel story actually was. Their discovery that the Hebrew word ""Timshel"" means ""thou mayest"" becomes an important symbol in the novel."
472,The Old Man and the Sea,"The Old Man and the Sea is the story of a battle between an old, experienced Cuban fisherman and a large marlin. The novel opens with the explanation that the fisherman, who is named Santiago, has gone 84 days without catching a fish. Santiago uses all the strength he has left in him to pull the fish onto its side and stab the marlin with a harpoon, ending the long battle between the old man and the tenacious fish. While Santiago continues his journey back to the shore, sharks are attracted to the trail of blood left by the Marlin in the water. By nightfall, the sharks have almost devoured theMarlin's entire carcass, leaving a skeleton consisting mostly of its backbone, its tail and its head. A group of fishermen gather the next day around the boat where the fish's skeleton is still attached. One of the fishermen measures it to be from nose to tail. Tourists at the nearby café mistakenly take it for a shark. The boy brings him newspapers and coffee. The old man wakes, and they promise to fish together once again. Upon his return to sleep, Santiago dreams of his youth—of lions on an African beach. The book is about a young Cuban fisherman named Santiago who is considered ""salao"", the worst form of unlucky. Santiago is so unlucky that his young apprentice, Manolin, has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the oldMan and been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen. Santiago tells Manolin that he will venture far out into the Gulf to fish, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end. On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago sets out alone, taking his skiff far onto the Gulf. He sets his lines and, by noon of the first day, a big fish that he is sure is a marlin takes his bait. The first, a great mako shark, Santiago kills with his harpoons, losing that weapon in the process. He makes a new harpoon by strapping his knife to the end of an oar to help ward off the next line of sharks; in total, five sharks are slain and many others are driven away. But the sharks keep coming, and by nightfall the shark's carcass is almost devouring the marincass. When Santiago reaches the shore before dawn, Santiago struggles on the way to his shack, carrying the heavy mast on his shoulder. Once home, he slumps onto his bed and falls into a deep sleep."
473,The Children of Men,"The novel opens with the first entry in Theo's diary. It is the year 2021, but the novel's events have their origin in 1995. In 1994, the sperm counts of human males plummeted to zero and mankind now faces imminent extinction. The last people to be born are now called ""Omegas"". ""A race apart,"" they enjoy various prerogatives. In 2006, a man called Xan Lyppiatt, Theo's rich and charismatic cousin, appointed himself Warden of England in the last general election. He is called a despot and a tyrant by his opponents, but officially the new society is referred to as egalitarian. Theo is approached by a woman called Julian, a member of a group of dissidents calling themselves the Five Fishes. The group wants Theo to approach Xan on their behalf and ask for various reforms, including a return to a more democratic system. During their discussions, and as Theo prepares to meet with Xan, the reader learns how the UK is in 2021. The country is governed by decree of the Council of England, which consists of five people. Parliament has been reduced to an advisory role. All convicted criminals are dumped at a penal colony on the Isle of Man. There is no remission, escape is almost impossible, visitors are forbidden and prisoners may not write or receive letters. Every citizen is required to learn skills, such as husbandry, which they might need to help them survive if they happen to be among the last human beings in Britain. Foreign workers are lured into the country and then exploited. At 60, which is the age limit, they are sent back (""forcibly repatriated""). British Omegas are not allowed to emigrate so as to prevent further loss of labor. Elderly/infirm citizens have become a burden; nursing homes are for the privileged few. The rest are expected and sometimes forced to commit suicide by taking part in a ""Quusus"" (sanctioned mass drownings) at the age of 60. Twice a year, the state has opened ""pornography centres"" for healthy women under 45 to submit to a gynecological examination, and men must have their sperm tested to keep them alive. The youngest generation are described as spoiled, over-entitled and egotistical due to their youth and the luxurious lifestyle they are treated to. They are violent, remote and unstable, and regard non-Omega (elders) with undisguised contempt. The latest trend in London is to have elaborate christening ceremonies for newborn pets."
474,The Spy Who Came in from the Cold," Alec Leamas is the Station Head of the British Secret Intelligence Service in West Berlin. He is recalled to the Circus in London by Control, chief of the Circus. Control asks Leamas to stay ""in the cold"" for one last mission: to turn (defect) and provide false information to the East German Communists that would implicate Mundt as a British double agent. Leamas believes helping Fiedler destroy Mundt is a worthy act. Meanwhile, in England, George Smiley and Peter Guillam appear at Liz Gold's apartment claiming to be friends of Alec, question her about him, and offer her financial help. Liz Gold is invited to East Germany for a Communist Party information exchange. The power struggle in the Abteilung comes into the open when Mundt orders Fiedlers and Leamas arrested and tortured. They are released, and Fiedrer and Mundt are summoned to present their cases to a tribunal convened in camera, in the town of Görlitz. At the trial, Leamas documents a series of secret bank account payments that Fieder matches to the movements of Mundt. He admits that Control gave him all the information he needed to frame him as a double agent, and offers to return for Liz's freedom. Realising that the operation is now blown, he assaults her the night before he assaulted the grocer. She admits that she had promised Leamas not to look for him when he disappeared. She also admits that he had said good-bye to her the day before he disappeared, and that he also had said he would not look for her when he returned to London. The novel ends with Liz Gold calling the unsuspecting Leamas's attorney as a surprise witness for the defence for the prosecution of the Mundt’s trial.

476,The Great White Hope,"The Great White Hope explores how segregation and prejudice created the demand for a ""great white hope"" who would defeat Jack Johnson. The play is often described as being thematically about racism, but this is not, it seems, entirely how Sackler viewed his work. In a comment, reflecting on both the racist theme dealt with in the play and Sackler's notion that the play is about a man fighting society, Muhammad Ali apparently commented to the actor, ""That's my story. You take out the issue of white women and replace it with theissue of religion. That's my stories!"" He was fighting being drafted into the army at the time on grounds of being a conscientious objector. Ali was being drafted to serve in the U.S. Army at that time and was being treated as a ""citizen"" by the Army Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) The play ends with a speech by Sackler about the role of race in society and how it has changed over the years. The final performance of the play takes place on November 11, 2013. The show is directed by Michael Aronofsky and will run until November 14, 2013, at the Palace Theatre in New York City.

477,The Postman,"Despite the post-apocalyptic scenario, and several action sequences, the book is largely about civilization and symbols. Each of the three sections deals with a different symbol. In the third section, as the Postman joins forces with the Cyclops scientists in a war against an influx of ""hypersurvivalists"", he begins to find traces of them. The final scenes give the impression that the three symbols may rally together in an effort to revive civilization. Many times through the book, curses are uttered which damn Holn for his actions. Nathan Holn was an author who championed an extreme, violent, misogynistic and hypersurVivalist society. Holn is said to have himself been hanged in the novel, but in the time following what should have been a brief period of civil disorder, followers of Holn prevented the U.S. from recovering from the limited war, and the plagues that followed. The Bear Flag of California is the symbol that they rally behind: the symbol of California. The book was written in the early 1990s and published by Simon & Schuster, with a print run of 1,000 copies. It is now published in hardback with a hardback cover and a hardcover edition of 2,500 copies. The hardback has been published in the UK and the US with a cover price of £12.99, with the UK paperback version of £16.99. The US paperback edition has been released in the late 1990s. The UK paperback edition of the book has a cover of £14.99 and the UK edition of £15.99 (with a paperback copy of £18.99). The US edition has a front cover of the same price, but the front cover has a different front cover and the back cover has an image of a man in a postal uniform. The author has no idea who the man in the postman uniform is, but believes that he is a real postman. The novel was published in 1998 and has been translated into several languages, including English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Spanish. It was published by Macmillan, which published it as a trade paperback in 1999.

478,The Phantom of the Opera,"Christine Daaé is the daughter of a famous fiddler. Her father tells her many stories featuring an ""Angel of Music"" Christine is eventually given a position in the chorus at the Paris Opera House. She begins hearing a beautiful, unearthly voice which sings to her and speaks to her. The Voice, however, belongs to Erik, a physically-deformed and mentally-disturbed charismatic genius who was one of the architects who took part in the construction of the opera. He has been extorting money from the Opera's management for many years. After the chandelier accident, Erik kidnaps Christine to his home in the cellars and reveals his true identity. He plans to keep her there only a few days, hoping she will come to love him, and Christine begins to find herself attracted to her abductor. But she causes Erik to change his plans when she unmasks him and, to the horror of both, beholds his face, which according to the book, resembles the face of a rotting corpse. To save them and the people below, Erik threatens to destroy the entire Opera using explosives, killing everyone in the floors above. If she refuses to marry him, Erik doesn't drown them in the water, stating that he doesn't want to drown them. To rescue them, Erik uses an old acquaintance of his, known only as ""The Persian"", in an attempt to rescue her. Christine agrees to go with him, but she pities Erik and will not go until she has sung for him one last time. She then realizes the ring has slipped off her finger and fallen into the streets somewhere, and begins to panic. The two leave. But neither is aware that Erik has been listening to their conversation or that it has driven him to jealous frenzy. Christine continues to refuse, until she realizes that an old friend, Raoul, promises to take Christine away where Erik can never find her and to take her even if she resists. Raoul tells Christine he shall act on his promise the following day, to which Christine agrees. But both are unaware that Erik is listening to them and that he has driven them to jealous frenzies. Christine then realizes that the Voice is not real and that Raoul has been lying to her about his love for her and that she must go with Erik the next day. But the two leave together and Christine realizes that he is not the Phantom of the Opera, but the Viscount of Chagny."
479,Murder on the Orient Express,"Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express in Constantinople. On the second night he gets a compartment to himself. The next day he awakens to find that Mr. Ratchett is dead, having been stabbed twelve times in his sleep. He finds several more clues in the victim's cabin and on board the train, including a linen handkerchief embroidered with the initial ""H"", a pipe cleaner, and a button from a conductor's uniform. All of these clues suggest that the murderer or murderers were somewhat sloppy. However, each clue seemingly points to different suspects, which suggests that some of the clues were planted. As the evidence mounts, it continues to point in wildly different directions and it appears thatPoirot is being challenged by a mastermind. A critical piece of missing evidence, the scarlet kimono worn the night of the murder by an unknown woman, turns up in the luggage of M. Bouc and Dr. Constantine in the restaurant car. The first explanation is that a stranger&ndash;some enemy ofRatchett's murder was on the train at the last stop, murdered for reasons unknown, and escaped unnoticed. The second is that the victim and several others failed to note that the train had crossed into a different time zone just just before 1:00 am, because everyone thought that the crime occurred an hour earlier than everyone thought, because the victim had left the train earlier than the others. The third is that PoiroT must surely be aware that this does not explain the circumstances of the crime, but does not fully explain the reasons for it. The final chapter is about the death of the American heiress Daisy Armstrong, who was kidnapped and murdered by a notorious fugitive from the U.S. Five years earlier, Cassetti kidnapped three-year-old Daisy Armstrong and fled the country with the money. The shock sent her into premature labour, and both she and the baby died. Daisy's mother, Sonia, was pregnant when she heard of Daisy's death, and her husband, Colonel Armstrong, shot himself out of grief. Although Cassetti was caught, his resources allowed him to get himself acquitted on an unspecified technicality, although he still fled thecountry to escape further prosecution for the crime. The book ends with a scene in which a woman in a scarletkimono retreats down the passage in the distance, and he sees nothing except the back of her retreating down the passageway. It is the last book in the series."

481,Equus,"Martin Dysart is a psychiatrist in a psychiatric hospital. He meets Alan Strang, a troubled young man who is obsessed with horses. Dysart begins to jog Alan's memory by filling in blanks of the dialogue, and asking questions. Alan's sexual training began with his mother, who told him that the sexual act was dirty, but that he could find true love and contentment by way of religious devotion and marriage. During this time he also begins to show a sexual attraction to horses, desiring to pet their thick coats, feel their muscular bodies and smell their sweat. Alan also envisions himself as a king, on the head of Equus, destroying their enemies by both destroying their bodies and getting naked with them. The play ends with Alan having sex with Jill Mason, who had taken an interest in him, after which he runs into his father, who tries to justify his presence in the theater, when he realized that his father was lying when he said that he was lying about being in the movie. The two men have sex, but Alan breaks it off when he realizes his father is lying and that he is not the one who ran into the movie theater, but his father. In the end, Alan realizes that sex is a natural thing for all men, even his father—even if he is lying about his father being lying about what he is doing, and they have sex again, despite his father's attempts to stop them. It is the last scene of the play, in which Dysart hypnotizes Alan, and during the hypnosis, reveals elements of his terrifying dream of the ritual murder of children. The film ends on a cliffhanger, with Alan's father telling him that he has to kill his son to break free from the chains of existence, and that the only way to do so is to kill him. The movie was released on September 14, 2013. The book is available on Blu-ray and DVD. The DVD is available in the U.S. only; the Blu-Ray version does not include any of the deleted scenes, and the DVD does not have the audio version of the film, which is available only in the United States only.

482,American Psycho,"American Psycho is about the daily life of wealthy young investment banker Patrick Bateman. Bateman narrates his everyday activities, from his recreational life among the Wall Street elite of New York to his forays into murder by nightfall. The novel maintains a high level of ambiguity through mistaken identity and contradictions that introduce the possibility that Bateman is an unreliable narrator. Whether any of the crimes depicted in the novel actually happened or whether they were simply the fantasies of a delusional psychotic is deliberately left open. The book ends as it began, with Bateman and his colleagues in a club on a Friday night, engaging in banal conversation. In the book, Bateman's control over his violent urges deteriorates. His murders become increasingly sadistic and complex, progressing from simple stabbings to drawn out sequences of torture, rape, mutilation, cannibalism, and necrophilia. He begins to experience bizarre hallucinations such as seeing a Cheerio interviewed on a talk show, being stalked by an anthropomorphic park bench, and finding a bone in his Dove Bar. These incidents culminate in a shooting spree during which he kills several random people in the street, resulting in a SWAT team being dispatched in a helicopter. In a later chapter, he calls his attorney, Harold Carnes, and confesses all his crimes to the answering machine. Carnes tells Bateman that he is too much of a coward to have committed such acts and claims that he had dinner in London with Paul Owen a few days before. In another section, he confronts Carnes about the message only to find Carnes is amused at what he considers to be a good joke. He runs into a real estate agent showing the apartment to prospective buyers; the real-estate agent appears suspicious of Bateman, as though meant to hide a bad odor. He ends the book as it started, with the book ending as it beginning, with him and his colleague in a nightclub on a Saturday night. In an earlier section, the book is broken up by chapters in which he directly addresses the reader in order to critique the work of 1980s Pop music artists. He introduces stories about serial killers into casual conversations and on several occasions openly confesses his murderous activities to his coworkers, who never take him seriously, do not hear what he says, or misunderstand him completely—for example, hearing the words ""murders and executions"" as ""mergers and acquisitions"" Bateman revisits Paul Owen's apartment, where he had killed and mutilated two prostitutes, and enters the perfectly clean, refurbished apartment, which shows no trace of decomposing bodies but is filled with strong-smelling flowers."
483,Kalimantaan,"Ms. Godshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. Although many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an ""air of permanence"" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on Margaret Brooke, wife of the second Rajah, and her book ""My Life in Sarawak"". Gideon maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship. The massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The author provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, but it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of Kalimantaan will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author: {| class=""wikitable""! Malay! English |- | abang | elder brother, tradition, custom, custom;- | ajar | to teach;. bulan | moon, month;. bujang | bachelor; buaya | crocodile; bulbul | nightingale;. datin | wife of a datu; datu | minister in traditional Malay government;. hantu, antu | ghost, spirit, liver, emotion, typically translated ""heart"") (as well as ikanikat | ikan, fish, head;. jaga, kain, jaga (in the street, belt) describes a story, it describes a road, it. describes the story of the road, the story, the road.

484,Creatures of Light and Darkness,"The Universe was once ruled by the god Thoth, who administered the different forces in the Universe to keep things in balance. At some point, Thoth had awakened a dormant, malevolent force on a distant planet. This dark force, called the Thing That Cries In The Night, is so powerful and malevolent that it nearly obliterated Thoth's wife and threatens to consume the galaxy. Thoth works to contain and destroy the creature, and in so doing, neglects his duties in maintaining the Universe. The Angels become rebellious and use the power vacuum to fight amongst themselves for dominance. Some of the surviving Angels either hide among the peoples of the Universe as mysterious ""immortals"", but others—Osiris and Anubis—take over the House of Life and House of Death, respectively. Osiris cultivates life where he can, while Anubis works to destroy it. Plenty and famine, proliferation and plague, overpopulation and annihilation, alternate in the Worlds of Life between the two Stations, much to the detriment of those who inhabit them. The geography of this universe contains several curious places: The planet Blis is filled to bursting with people who are inexhaustibly fertile and do not know death. One man agrees to commit suicide in front of an audience, for money to be given to his family, because most people on Bliss have never seen a death. He does so by self-immolation, after receiving the Possibly Proper Death Litany (also called the Agnostic's Prayer). * On fog-shrouded D'donori, warlords raid each others solely to capture prisoners, who will be vivisected by town scrier. On an unnamed planet, the sea is above the atmosphere, or the normal planet cannot survive on a normal planet. In a cave, a dog worries a glove that has seen better centuries. On another planet, drug-maddened priests worship a pair of old shoes and casten spearmen protect and protect and castrated priests worship and protect them. Here the Prince Who Was a Thousand keeps Nephthys, his wife, who was disembodied and disembodied, and who was also disembodied. He also revives the personality of his wife and keeps her safe on a special world known only to him, where the seas are above the Atmosphere, not below them. He scatters Set's weapons and armor across the Universe for safe-keeping in the event that Set can ever be found."
485,The Handmaid's Tale,"The novel is set in the near future in the Republic of Gilead, a country formed within the borders of what was formerly the United States of America. It was founded by a racist, homophobic, christian, nativist, theocratic-organized military coup as an ideologically driven response to the pervasive ecological, physical and social degradation of the country. The story is presented from the point of view of a woman called Offred (literally Of-Fred, however not a patronymic as some critics claim) The character is one of a class of individuals kept as concubines (""handmaids"") for reproductive purposes by the ruling class in an era of declining births. The book is told in the first person by Offred, who describes her life during her third assignment as a handmaid, in this case to Fred (referred to as ""The Commander""). If Offred fails to become pregnant on this, her third attempt, she will be declared an ""unwoman"" and discarded. Interspersed in flashbacks are portions of her life from before and during the beginning of the revolution, when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband. The novel concludes with a metafictional epilogue that explains that events of the novel occurred shortly after what is called the ""Gilead Period"" They created a ""probable"" order for Offred's narrative to be recorded onto tapes, and these tapes were recorded onto a cassette tape called ""Probable Order for The Handmaid's Tale"" Professor Pieixoto, Professor Knotly, and ""a colleague"", Professor Wade, discovered these tapes and recorded them onto a tape called 'probable order for the Handmaids' The tapes were later discovered to be a ""transcription of a symposium"" written some time in the distant future (2195) according to the speaker's ""keynote"" Professor Knotley, Professor Piexoto, and Professor Wade recorded these tapes on a tape recorder called 'Probable' The tape was later found to have a hidden audio file of the symposium, and the tapes were used as the basis for the novel. The tapes have been released to the public and are available for download on the Internet. They can be found at: http://www.amazon.com/The-Handmaids-Tale-Probable-Tape-Recording-Tapes-2195-probable-order-the-symposium-theory-theater-theatre-theorexample-theo-keynove."

492,On Numbers and Games,"A game in the sense of Conway is a position in a contest between two players, Left and Right. Each player has a set of games called options to choose from in turn. Games are written {L|R} where L is the set of Left's options and R is theSet of Right's options. All numbers are positive, negative, or zero, and we say that a game is positive if Left will win, negative if Right will win or zero if the second player will win. Games that are not numbers have a fourth possibility: they may be fuzzy, meaning that the first player will wins. * is a fuzzy game. A more extensive introduction to On Numbers and Games is available online. The game {0|0} is called, and is the first game we find that is not a number. It is the only game that has no element that is negative or positive, and is called -1. It's also the first games that are fuzzy, and are called -0. It has a maximum score of 1. It can be played by any player who has no options to have lost the game. The maximum number of options a player can choose from is 0, and this is the maximum number that can be chosen to win the game by a player who does not have any options to lose the game but has played a turn. This defines the game {|}, which is called 0. Given this game 0 there are now two possible sets of options, the empty set and the set whose only element is zero. This is the game 1, and the game  -1, and it is called 1/0/1/0 or -1/1/. It is also the name of the game in which a player must play a turn but has no Options to have won the game, which is -1 /1/2 or -0/2. It may also be called -2, -3, -4, or -5, and these are the names of the games in which no options are available to the player who must play. The games are played by players who have no options at all, so there are no games at all. The empty set is now the only set of options we can provide to the players. The set with no members is called the set without any members. It contains the set 0, which has no members and is known as the set that is empty. It also contains the only element that has a negative number, and that is the number zero."

The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by.

495,Seven Brothers,"At first, the brothers are not a particularly peaceful lot and end up quarreling with the local constable, jury, vicar, churchwarden, and teachers.

Eventually they end up moving to distant Impivaara in the middle of relative wilderness, but their first efforts are shoddy. Next spring they try again and manage to kill a hostile herd of bulls.

496,Steppenwolf,"The book is presented as a manuscript by its protagonist, a middle-aged man named Harry Haller, who leaves it to a chance acquaintance, the nephew of his landlady. In his aimless wanderings about the city he encounters a person carrying an advertisement for a magic theatre who gives him a small book, Treatise on the Steppenwolf. This treatise, cited in full in the novel's text as Harry reads it, strikes him as describing himself uncannily. It is a discourse of a man who believes himself to be of two natures: one high, the spiritual nature of man; while the other is low, animalistic, a ""wolf of the steppes"". This man is entangled in an irresolvable struggle, never content with either nature because he cannot see beyond this self-made concept. The next day Harry meets a former academic friend with whom he had often discussed Oriental mythology, and who invites Harry to his home. While there, Harry is disgusted by the nationalistic mentality of his friend, who inadvertently criticizes a column Harry wrote. In turn, Harry offends the man and his wife by criticizing the wife's picture of Goethe, which Harry feels is too thickly sentimental and insulting to Goethe's true brilliance. This episode confirms to Harry that he is, and will always be, a stranger to his society. The Magic Theatre is a place where he experiences the fantasies that exist in his mind. They are described as a long horseshoe-shaped corridor that is a mirror on one side and a great many doors on the other. Then, Harry enters five of these labeled doors, each of which symbolizes a fraction of his life. After attending a lavish masquerade ball, Pablo brings him to his metaphorical ""magic theatre,"" where concerns and notions that plagued his soul disintegrate while he interacts with the ethereal and phantasmal. After a second meeting, Hermine introduces Harry to the indulgences of what he calls the ""bourgeois"" She teaches Harry to dance, introduces him to casual drug use, finds him a lover (Maria), and, more importantly, forces him to accept these as legitimate and worthy aspects of a full life. Hermine promises a second meet, and provides Harry with a reason to live (or at least a substantial excuse to continue living) that he eagerly embraces. Hermines alternately mocks Harry's self-pity and indulges him in his explanations regarding his view of life, to his astonished relief."
497,Goldfinger," Fleming structured the novel in three sections: ""Happenstance"", ""Coincidence"" and ""Enemy action"" Goldfinger described Bond's three seemingly coincidental meetings with him.

At the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership, he is killed by Oddjob. Bond wakes up to find he has been captured by Goldfinger who has captured him.

502,Jingo,"The island of Leshp, which had been submerged under the Circle Sea for centuries, rises to the surface. Its position makes the island a powerful strategical point for whoever lays claim to it, which both cities do. In Ankh-Morpork, a Klatchian Prince named Khufurah is parading through the city when an assassination attempt occurs, and the Prince is wounded. The attempted assassination breaks off relations with Klatch as the Prince's brother effectively declares war on the city. At this point, Havelock Vetinari resigns and Lord Rust takes command of the city, and Vimes stands down as Commander of the Watch. Vimes then recruits the Watch into his own private army regiment, reasoning that, as an official noble, he is entitled to do so by law and by Lord Rust's command. Meanwhile, Nobby and Sergeant Colon have been recruited by Vet inari and his pet inventor, Leonard of Quirm, on a secret mission of their own, unknown to Vimes. They end up in Leonard's ""Going-Under-the-Water-Safely Device"" and discover that LeshP is actually floating on top of a huge bubble of gas (suggested to be methane or some other poisonous gas), and that the gas is escaping from said bubble, meaning that Leschenp will, ultimately, sink back under the sea again. The three also head to Gebra, where they discover that Carrot has convinced the two armies to get together and play a game of football. In the end, Carrot and the Klatchians win the game, but as Leshenp has vanished back to sea again, the treaty was to be signed in a non-existent territory and thus the charge of treason is invalid. Since Carrot was speaking to the King of Ankh Morpork of all places, the charge is not invalid, but of ""reminding him of his old rank of Commander"" Vimes is informed that the rank of Duke was the same as that of the old Duke. He objects, claiming that only a King can make a real Duke, but then remembers that he is not the real King. He is then reminded that the Duke is the only person who can make such a real claim, and so he is forced to give up his claim to the title. He then goes on to become the new Duke, and claims that the title of Duke is only a title that can only be given to a man who is a member of the Royal Family."

504,Moonraker,"Sir Hugo Drax is the product of a mysterious background, unknown even to himself (allegedly) As a supposed British soldier in World War II, he was badly injured and stricken with amnesia in the explosion of a bomb planted by a German saboteur at a British field headquarters. After extensive rehabilitation in an army hospital, however, he eventually returned home to become a major aerospace industrialist. After building his fortune and establishing himself in business and society, Drax started building the ""Moonraker"", Britain's first nuclear missile project. After a Ministry of Supply security officer working at the project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what has been going on at the missile-building base. All of the rocket scientists working on the project were German. He also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the former Security Chief may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast. He now means to destroy London with the very missile he has constructed for Britain, by means of a Soviet-supplied nuclear warhead that has been secretly fitted to the Moonraker. Gala Brand, a beautiful Special Branch agent working undercover as Personal Assistant to Drax, is caught. She soon finds herself captive at a secret radio station (intended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system) in the heart of London. While attempting to rescue her in a car chase, Bond is also captured. Drax tells Bond that he was never a British soldier and has never suffered from amnesia. The amnesia story was simply a cover he used while recovering in hospital, in order to avoid allied retribution, although it would lead to a whole new British identity. He remains a dedicated Nazi, bent on revenge against England for the wartime defeat of his Fatherland and his prior history of social slights suffered as a youth growing up in an English boarding school before the war. He plans to play the stock market the day before to make a huge profit from the imminent disaster. He and his henchman attempt to escape by all along, only to be killed as the vessel flees through the very waters onto which the moonraker has been re-targeted. After this first (supposedly un-armed) test firing, Bond and Gala escape and escape the proper coordinates to redirect the gyros into the sea. Bond meets up with Gala expecting her company—but she reveals that she is engaged to be married to a fellow Special Branch officer."
505,Sophie's Choice,"Sophie's Choice is narrated by Stingo, a novelist who is recalling the summer when he began his first novel. Stingo is drawn into the lives of the lovers Nathan Landau and Sophie Zawistowska, fellow boarders at the house. Sophie is a beautiful, Polish-Catholic survivor of the concentration camps of World War II. Nathan is a Jewish-American – and, purportedly, a genius, but he is a paranoid schizophrenic who is self-medicating with drugs, including cocaine and benzadrine, that he supposedly obtains at Pfizer, his employer. The story progresses as Sophie tells Stingo of her past, of which she has never before spoken, and how she chose to sacrifice her seven-year-old daughter, Eva, in a heart-rending decision that has left her in mourning and filled with a guilt that she cannot overcome, Stingo writes in the book. The novel ends when Stingo discovers that Sophie and Nathan have committed suicide by ingesting sodium cyanide, and he is devastated, he writes in a letter to Stingo's father. The reader also learns what became of Sophie's daughter, named Eva, only at the end of the book does the reader also learn what becameof Sophie's son, who was interned by the Nazis in the Lebensborn program, in which he would be raised as a German child. He writes: ""He could have been fantastically brilliant at anything he might have tried out … But he never got his mind in order.""

On the way there, Sophie reveals her deepest, darkest secret: on the night that she arrived at Auschwitz, a sadistic doctor made her choose which of her two children would die immediately by gassing and which would continue to live, albeit in the camp. She failed in her attempts to seduce Höss in an effort to persuade him that her blond, blue-eyed, German-speaking son should be allowed to leave the camp and enter the LeBensbornProgram. She fails in this attempt and, ultimately, she never learned of her son's fate. The book ends with Stingo proposing marriage to her, but Sophie disappears, leaving only a note in which she says that she must return to Nathan."
506,Season of the Jew,"In this story of New Zealand and Te Kooti's War during the year beginning November 10, 1868, the narrative coalesces around the development of its protagonist, George Fairweather. Fairweather paradoxically finds his feelings of humanity expanding to include Englishmen, colonials and Māoris, coupled with a growing resentment of racism and injustice. In the end he almost throws his future away by struggling to save a Māori boy, Hamiora (reminiscent of Melville’s Billy Budd), unjustly charged with treason. With the hanging of Hamioro, November 10,. 1869, and the conclusion of Fairweather’S desperate attempts first to prevent and then to mitigate it, the book ends. The problem of Te Kootsi is not resolved, except in the brief epilogue, further revealing the depths of Fair weather’'s ambivalence about the historical figure of TeKootsi, Fairweather's hated and admired nemesis and one-time friend. The book ends with Fairweather trying to prevent the hanging, and his desperate attempts to prevent it. It is published by Simon & Schuster, priced $24.99.

The story is about a former British officer in his early forties, who leaves the service under a cloud, turns landscape painter and cultivates an air of worldly detachment. Yet he finds himself drawn by love and humanity back into the world of colonial New Zealand. He is described as “A composite character... yet still far from fictional”"
507,The White Plague,"John Roe O'Neill's wife and children are killed by an IRA bomb on May 20, 1996. Driven halfway insane by loss, his mind fragments into several personalities that carry out his plan for him. He plans a genocidal revenge and creates a plague that kills women. He then releases it in Ireland (for supporting the terrorists), England (for oppressing the Irish and giving them a cause), and Libya (for training said terrorists) He demands that the governments of the world send all citizens of those countries back to their countries, and that they quarantine those countries and let the plague run its course, so they will lose what he has lost. If they do not, he has more plagues to release. After releasing the plague, he goes to Ireland to hide, planning to offer his services as a molecular biologist in the hopes of sabotaging whatever work is done there on finding a cure. To travel to the lab at Killaloe, he is forced to walk with a priest, a boy who has taken a vow of silence due to the death of his mother, and Joseph Herity, the IRA bomber who detonated the explosive that killed O’Neill’s wife and kids. Their purpose is to confirm his identity, either through Herity's indirect questioning, or the possibility that he will confess to the priest when confronted with the pain his revenge has caused for the boy. Meanwhile, law and order has broken down in England and Ireland, and the old Irish ways are coming back. Local IRA thugs appoint themselves ""kings of old"", and others recreate ancient Celtic pagan religions centered on the rowan tree. The IRA has effective control of Ireland, but as the governments grow certain that O'Neil is there and essentially in custody, they consider wiping out the three targeted countries to end the lingering threat. When he arrives in Ireland,. he is suspected of being O'Neal (whom the investigatory agencies of theworld have deduced is responsible). To travel with a Priest, aBoy who has taking a vow to silence due. to the deaths of his parents, and a bomber who detonates the bomb that killed his wife and. children. The purpose of the trip is to find out if he is the bomber or if the priest will ask him to reveal his identity or if he will be forced to do so himself. The priest asks him to travel with the boy, and he reveals his identity. The boy is then forced to reveal that he was the bomber."
508,The Pilgrim's Progress,"Christian is the protagonist of the allegory, which centres itself in his journey from his hometown, the ""City of Destruction"" (""this world""), to the ""Celestial City"" (""that which is to come"": Heaven) atop Mt. Zion. Christian is weighed down by a great burden, the knowledge of his sin, which he believed came from his reading ""the book in his hand,"" (the Bible) This burden, which would cause him to sink into Tophet (hell), is so unbearable that Christian must seek deliverance. He meets Evangelist as he is walking out in the fields, who directs him to the 'Wicket Gate' for deliverance, which Christian thinks he sees. Christian leaves his home, his wife, and children to save himself: he cannot persuade them to accompany him. After Christian is relieved of his burden, he is greeted by three shining ones, who give him the greeting of peace, new garments, and a scroll as a passport into the Celestial City — these are allegorical figures indicative of Christian Baptism. Christian spends his first stop for the night at the House Beautiful, which is an allegory of the local Christian congregation. As night falls Christian enters the Valley of the Shadow of Death, where he is in the middle of the gloom and terror. When the sun rises on a new day he meets Faithful, a former resident of the City of Destruction, who accompanies him to Vanity Fair, where both are arrested and detained because of their disdain for the wares and business of the fair. Faithful is put on trial and executed as a martyr, taking Christian to the place of Faithful and Hopeful, also a resident of Vanity Fair. Christian finally reaches the ""place of deliverance"" (allegorically, the cross of Calvary and the open sepulcher of Christ), where the ""straps"" that bound Christian's burden to him break, and it rolls away into theopen sepulchre. This event happens relatively early in the narrative: the immediate need of Christian at the beginning of the story being quickly remedied. In the Second Part, Good-will is shown to be Jesus himself. Christian makes his way from there to the House of the Interpreter, where the pictures and tableaux that portray or dramatize aspects of the Christian faith and life are called ""emblems"" Roger Sharrock denotes them ""emblem"" as a reference to the Bible, Heb. 6:11-18."
509,The Santaroga Barrier,"A psychologist, Gilbert Dasein, is hired by corporate interests to investigate a town in a valley where marketing seems totally ineffective. The last few psychologists sent in have all died in accidents that are (seemingly) perfectly plausible. Complicating matters further still, the psychologist's college girlfriend, Jenny, has returned to Santaroga. Santarogans aren't hostile, they just won't shop there; neither are they xenophobic, instead appearing maddeningly self-satisfied with their quaint, local lifestyle. Their newspapers are vaguely subversive with their folksy, enlightened commentary on world affairs. Their dinner conversations knowledgeably reference great theories of psychology, politics, and cognitive science. As Jenny tries to convince him to settle down with her there, he wonders whether he'll live long enough to decide. The film is out now on Blu-ray and DVD.

510,Orlando Furioso,"The action of Orlando Furioso takes place against the background of the war between the Christian emperor Charlemagne and the Saracen King of Africa. Orlando has been tempted to forget his duty to protect the emperor through his love for the pagan princess Angelica. When Orlando learns the truth, he goes mad with despair and rampages through Europe and Africa destroying everything in his path. The English knight Astolfo journeys to Ethiopia on the hippogriff to find a cure for Orlando's madness. He flies up to the moon (in Elijah's flaming chariot no less) where everything lost on earth is to be found, including Orlando's wits. Orlando joins with Brandimart and Oliver to fight Agramante, Sobrino and Gradasso on the island of Lampedusa. There Orlando kills King Agramantes. The epic contains many other characters, including the paladin Rinaldo, who is also in love with Angelica; the thief Brunello; and the tragic heroine Isabella. They too have to endure many vicissitudes. Ruggiero and Bradamante are the ancestors of the House of Este, Ariosto's patrons, whose genealogy he gives at length in canto 3 of the poem. The poem ends with Ruggierso slaying Rodomonte in single combat. The author explains that love is itself a form of insanity, and that Orlando falls out of love withangelica. He also explains that Orlando's love for Angelica is the reason he is so mad, and the reason why he kills her. He explains this at the same time that Orlando is cured of his madness by Astolfe's flying chariot, which takes him to Ethiopia to find his wits in a bottle and makes Orlando sniff them, thus restoring him to sanity. It ends with Orlando and Angelica on their way to Cathay, where they meet Medoro and fall in love, and elopes with him toCathay. They also have to avoid the enchantments of his foster father, the wizard Atlante, who does not want him to fight. Finally, Ruggiereo converts to Christianity and marries Bradamante, and accuses him of being a traitor to the SarACen cause. The pair are eventually freed from Alcina's magic island and the pair are married. The story ends with the wedding feast and the wedding of Bradamrante and Ruggierio, who are later to become the first Christians."
511,The Anatomy of Melancholy,"The Anatomy of Melancholy is an especially lengthy book, the first edition being a single quarto volume nearly 900 pages long. Much of the book consists of quotations from various ancient and mediæval medical authorities, beginning with Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen. The text is divided into three major sections plus an introduction, the whole written in Burton's sprawling style. Most modern editions include many explanatory notes, and translate most of the Latin. The Anatomy concludes with an extensive index, which, many years later, The New York Times Book Review called ""a readerly pleasure in itself"" The first section focuses on the causes and symptoms of ""common"" melancholies, while the second section deals with cures for melancholy. The third section explores more complex and esoteric melancholy, including the melancholy of lovers and all varieties of religious melancholie. The author also included a great deal of Latin poetry in the Anatomy, and many of his inclusions from ancient sources are left untranslated in the text. The first edition was a single four-volume volume nearly900 pages long; subsequent editions were even longer. In attacking his stated subject, Burton drew from nearly every science of his day, including psychology and physiology, but also astronomy, meteorology, and theology, and even astrology and demonology. Burton defined his subject as follows: ""Melancholies are not the same as melancholy, they are the opposite of it."" The author's note to the Reader includes not only an author's notes, but a Latin poem (""Democritus Junior to His Book""), a warning to ""The Reader Who Employs His Leisure Ill"", an abstract of the following text, and another poem explaining the frontispiece. The following three sections proceed in a similarly exhaustive fashion: the first section focus on the Causes and Symptoms of "" common"" melanchols, the second sections deals with cure for melancholy, and the third section deals in more complex ways with more complex melancholian symptoms. In the introduction to the book, Burton also includes a poem, a warning, and a poem explaining how to take care of one's health. The book concludes with the Index, which most modern editions have translated and include many explanations of how to use the index, as well as an explanation of how the index was created. It is published in two volumes, one in English and the other in Latin, and is available in many editions, including many modern editions."
512,Piers Plowman,"The poem is part theological allegory, part social satire. It concerns the narrator's quest for the true Christian life, from the perspective of mediæval Catholicism. The poem begins in the Malvern Hills in Malvern, Worcestershire. In the early part of the poem Piers, the humble plowman of the title, appears and offers himself as the narrator’s guide to Truth. The latter part of. the work, however, is concerned with the Narrator's search for Dowel, Dobet and Dobest. Between these symbols of heaven and hell is a ""fair field full of folk"", representing the world of mankind. The narrator's dream-visions and an examination into the lives of three allegorical characters, Dowel (""Do-Well""), Dobet ("" do-Better""), and Dobst (""do-best"") lead to the poem's conclusion. It is written in the form of a single word: ""Dowel"" or ""Dobet"". The poem was written in 1847. It was published in 1849. It has been translated into English as ""The Dream of Dowel"" and as ""Do-Best"" by William Makepeace Thackeray (1849-1955) and as ""The Dream Of Dobel"" by William Makepeace Twentieth (1854-1954). It was written by a man named Will, and published by the London School of Poetry in 1853. It concerns the narrator 's quest for the true life, and an examination into the lives of three allegory characters, Dowal, Dobel and Dobet. The work was written in the period between 1847 and 1854. It also occurs in 1855 and 1856. It contains a number of short stories, including ""D Dowel"", ""Dobest"" and ""Do-Better"", as well as a short story called ""Doubts"" about the meaning of the word ""doubts"". It was written by Will Will, who was a member of the Church of England."
513,Red Storm Rising,"Islamic terrorists from Azerbaijan destroy a Soviet oil-production facility at Nizhnevartovsk, Russia. The Politburo instead decides to seize the oil fields in the Persian Gulf by military force. According to the Carter Doctrine, any attack on the Gulf is an attack on strategic interests to the United States, necessitating a military response. To prevent a combined reaction by NATO, the Soviets launch a KGB operation to carry out a false flag operation framing West Germany for an unprovoked attack on USSR. Afterwards, the USSR plans to invade Europe in response to that “attack’s’. The Soviets advance at great cost, having dramatically underestimated NATO defensive firepower. The Soviet Navy is able to act as an offensive weapon contrary to pre-war NATO expectations, becoming a major strategic threat against resupply convoys coming from North America with both aircraft and submarines. In West Germany, the battle becomes a war of attrition that the Soviets expect to win through slow and sustained advances. The more competent CinC-Southwest and his second-in-command, General-Colonel Pavel Leonidovich Alekseyev take over on the German front. As the OMG (Operational Manoeuvre Group) forces start to deploy, NATO looks likely to lose all of the Weser River River to the Soviets. When a Soviet attack on east of Germany (Operative River) fails, NATO loses all of its most effective cruise missile bases. The U.S. Marines take this opportunity to stage an amphibious assault on Iceland backed by NATO navies, retaking the island and closing the Atlantic to Soviet forces. Simultaneously with the sudden reversal, the remaining Soviet naval cruise missile fleets are wiped out. The USSR is essentially wiped out in the Atlantic, opening the opening to direct attacks against its strategic areas and the free flow of convoys across the Northern Atlantic and the Northern Pacific. It is essentially a victory for the USSR, with the remaining bomber fleets virtually wiped out and the remaining naval missile fleets effectively wiped out across the northern Atlantic and Northern Pacific areas. It was a sudden reversal with the suddenly sudden reversal of the USSR's strategic and strategic and Northern Atlantic, and the sudden loss of the Northern Northern and Northern Northern convoys in the Northern hemisphere. It would be a surprise if the Soviets had managed to win the war in the Pacific theater or the Mediterranean region, as the Soviet Navy was able to protect its submarine fleet in costal waters behind minefields and ASW assets."
514,The Joy of Work,"The book is a response to Norman Solomon's 1997 book, The Trouble with Dilbert. Adams concludes that it is the 'proximity' of sensitive subjects to negative concepts that causes ""people who are angry for no good reason (nuts)"" to take offence. The 'Final Postscript' is a page dedicated to his cat 'Freddie', who died as the book was in its final stages. The last words in the book are ""That [pet ownership], my friend, is joy"". Scott also writes ""The third part of the book is made entirely out of invisible pages. If the book seems heavier than it looks, that's why."" The book is published by Simon & Schuster, priced at £20 (including Kindle) and is available to pre-order now.

515,Lady Chatterley's Lover,"The story concerns a young married woman, Constance (Lady Chatterley), whose upper-class husband has been paralyzed due to a war injury. Her sexual frustration leads her into an affair with the gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The class difference between the couple highlights a major motif of the novel which is the unfair dominance of intellectuals over the working class. The novel is about Constance's realisation that she cannot live with the mind alone; she must also be alive physically. This realisation stems from a heightened sexual experience Constance has only felt with Mellors, suggesting that love can only happen with the element of the body, not the mind.

516,A Staircase in Surrey,"In The Gaudy Duncan Patullo returns to his old college, after a long absence. The discovery of a lost masterpiece by Piero della Francesca proves crucial to the college's future fortunes. The character of the provost of the college is said to have been based on that of Henry Chadwick, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford during Stewart's own time there. Fantasy writer and Oxford don J.R. R. Tolkien appears as the elderly ""Professor Timberlake"" in this novel. In The Madonna of the Astrolabe Patulla copes with his ex-wife, the undergraduates' production of Tamburlaine, and the problems of raising enough money for the urgently-needed restoration of the crumbling Great Tower.

517,The Sorrows of Young Werther,"The majority of 'The Sorrows of Young Werther' is presented as a collection of letters written by Werther, a young artist of highly sensitive and passionate temperament. In these letters, Werther gives a very intimate account of his stay in the fictional village of Wahlheim (based on the town of Garbenheim, near Wetzlar) He is enchanted by the simple ways of the peasants there. He meets Charlotte, a beautiful young girl who is taking care of her siblings following the death of their mother. Despite knowing beforehand that Charlotte is already engaged to a man named Albert, he falls in love with her. His pain eventually becomes so great that he is forced to leave and go to Weimar. He suffers a great embarrassment when he forgetfully visits a friend on the day when the entire aristocratic set normally meets there. After composing a farewell letter (to be found after he commits suicide), he writes to Albert asking for his two pistols, under a pretence that he was going ""on a journey"". Lotte receives the request with great emotion and sends the pistols. Werther then shoots himself in the head, but does not expire until 12 hours after he has shot himself. He is buried under a linden tree, a tree he talks about frequently in his letters, and the funeral is not attended by clergymen, Albert or his beloved Lotte. He had realized even before this incident that one of them — Lotte, Albert, or Werther himself — had to die. Every day serves as a torturous reminder that Lotte will never be able to requite his love. He visits her one final time, and they are both overcome with emotion after Werther's recitation of a portion of ""Ossian"" Werther had realized before this event that one, or both, of them, would have to die, and he wrote to Albert to ask for his pistols. Lotte and Albert are now married, and Werther and Lotte have a close friendship. He spends the next few months cultivating a close friend with both of them. Out of pity for her friend and respect for her husband, Lotte comes to the decision that Werther must not visit her so frequently. After this, he suffers more than he did before, partially because Lotte is now married. He then writes to Lotte asking for her hand in marriage, and she sends him two pistols. He dies 12 hours later, and is buried in Weimar, where he had been staying with his friend Wilhelm."
518,"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling","Squire Allworthy and his sister Bridget are introduced in their wealthy estate in Somerset. Allworthy returns from London after an extended business trip and finds a baby sleeping in his bed. After searching the nearby village, Mrs Wilkins is told about a young woman called Jenny Jones, servant of a schoolmaster and his wife. Jenny is brought before them and admits being the baby's mother but refuses to reveal the father's identity. The plot then turns to Mrs Partridge, wife of the schoolteacher, who has discovered that Jenny gave birth to a bastard and had mistakenly thought that she had left their service of her own free will. Tom, who goes from 14-years-old to nineteen-years of age by the end of Book III, gets into trouble for killing a partridge on a neighbour's land. In fact he did it at the instigation of Black George, Allworthy's gamekeeper, but he refuses to tell Mr Allworthy who his partner-in-crime was. He is beaten by his master, Mr Thwackum, who resides at the house with another schoolmaster, a philosopher called Mr Square. Tom confesses that he sold the horse and gave the money to Black George and his family, now in financial straits after being dismissed.

519,Richard III,"The play begins with Richard describing the accession to the throne of his brother, King Edward. Richard plots to have his brother Clarence, who stands before him in the line of succession, conducted to the Tower of London over a prophecy he fed to the King. Richard next ingratiates himself with ""the Lady Anne"" – Anne Neville, widow of the Lancastrian Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. Despite initially hating him, Anne is won over by his pleas of love and repentance and agrees to marry him. Queen Margaret, Henry VI&#39;s widow, returns in defiance of her banishment and warns the squabbling nobles about Richard. The atmosphere at court is poisonous: the established nobles are at odds with the upwardly mobile relatives of Queen Elizabeth, a hostility fuelled by Richard's machinations. Richard orders two murderers to kill Clarence in the tower. Clarence wakes and pleads with the murderers, saying that men have no right to obey other men. When the murderers arrive, he reads their warrant (issued in the name of the King), and exits with the Keeper, who disobeys Clarence and leaves the two murderers the keys. He recalls the unity of Richard of York, bidding his brother Gloucester to go to his brother Edward and weep. Sardonically, Gloucester says: ""We will millstones on this murderer, echoing a millstone, and we will weep and think on this"" He recalls Richard's words: ""I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter. What, though I kill'd her husband and his father?"" Richard confides to the audience that he will discard her once she has served her purpose. The murderers arrive and kill Clarence, but Clarence does not believe him. He imagines dying and being tormented by the ghosts of his father-in-law (Warwick, Anne and Edward's father) and brother- in-law. Under the water Clarence sees the skeletons of thousands of men &#34;that fishes gnawed upon. He also sees gems, anchors, heaps of pearl, inestimable stones, unvalued jewels. All of these are &# 34;scatterd in the bottom of the sea. He adds that some of the jewels were in the skulls of the dead. The dream includes extremely visual language describing Clarence falling from an imaginary ship as a result of Gloucester, who had fallen from the hatches, striking him. Richard exults in having won her over despite all he has done to her."
520,The Fall,"The novel opens with Clamence sitting in the bar, Mexico City, casually talking to a stranger. He tells us that he used to lead an essentially perfect life in Paris as a highly successful and well-respected defence lawyer. The vast majority of his work centred around ""widow and orphan"" cases, that is, the poor and disenfranchised who otherwise would be unable to provide themselves with a proper defence before the law. However, late one night when crossing the Pont Royal on his way home from his ""mistress,"" he comes across a woman dressed in black leaning over the edge of the bridge. He had only walked a short distance when he heard the distinct sound of a body hitting the water. The sound of screaming was Despite ClamENCE's view of himself as a selfless advocate for the weak and unfortunate, he simply ignores the incident and continues on his path. The feeling of resentment gnaws at him and he runs through his mind what he thinks he should have done — namely strike his interlocutor when he suddenly punches him in the side of the head. Later, he returns to his car and drives away, utterly humiliated, and explains that ""a hundred times"" that he thinks what he should do is not to run away, but to strike the motorcyclist who had run him off the road and run away from him. The laughter is thus alarming because it immediately reminds him of his obvious failure to do anything whatsoever about the woman who had presumably drowned years before. He turns around to discover that the laughter, of course, was not directed at him, but probably originated from a far-off conversation between friends — such is the rational course of his thought. He later elaborates that his failure to doing anything was most probably because doing so would have required him to put his own personal safety in jeopardy. This implies that the laughing originated within himself, adding another dimension to the inner meaning of the scene. That evening on the Pont des Arts represents, for Clamences, the collision of his true self with his inflated self-image, and the final realization of his own hypocrisy becomes painfully obvious. A third and final incident initiatesClamence's downward spiral. One day while waiting at a stoplight, he is trapped behind a motorcycle which has stalled ahead of him and is unable to proceed once the light changes to green as a result. Other cars behind him start honking their horns, and he politely asks the man several times if he would please move his motorcycle off of the road so that others can drive around him."

522,The Man Who Fell to Earth,"Thomas Jerome Newton is a humanoid alien who comes to Earth seeking to construct a spaceship to ferry others from his home planet, Anthea, to Earth. Anthea is experiencing a terrible drought after many nuclear wars, and the population has dwindled to less than 300. Like all Antheans, he is super-intelligent, but he has been selected to complete this mission for his strength, due to the harsh climate and gravity of Earth compared to the cold, small Anthea. Getting to Earth via a lifeboat, Newton first lands in the state of Kentucky but quickly becomes familiarized with the environment and aspires to become an entrepreneur. He rises as the head of a technology-based conglomerate to incredible wealth. This wealth is needed to construct his own space vehicle program in order to ferry the rest of the Anthean population. Along the way he meets Betty Jo, a simple Kentucky woman. She falls in love with him. He does not share these feelings, but takes her, and his curious fuel-technician Nathan Bryce, as his few friends while he runs his company in the shadows. He creates a recording of alien messages which he hopes to be broadcast via radio to his home. His secret identity as an alien is discovered by Nathan Bryce and he is relieved to reveal his identity to someone for the first time. The story of Newton's blinding reaches the press in a frenzy and then is used by the Republican Party to depict the Democrats as being corrupt, and leads to their seizure of power, which is to inevitably lead to apocalypse. Newton, in a final confrontation with Bryce, is bitterly unable to continue his spaceship project due to planetary alignments having changed during captivity and the troubles of his blindness. However, the CIA arrests Newton, having followed him since his appearance on Earth and having recorded this private conversation with Bryce. They submit him to rigorous tests and analysis, but ultimately find that, despite much conclusive evidence of his alien identity, it would be pointless to release the results because the public would not believe the truth. Such claims would also reflect poorly on the Democratic Party, responsible for the capture. The CIA releases Newton, but no sooner than he tries to exit his building, the FBI, uninformed by the CIA that Newton is exempt from further tests, commences their own brief examinations. Their final examination is ultimately an X-ray of Newton’s skull, through his eyes. He tries to stop them to no avail and is blinded. He hopes to make use of their superintelligence to influence Earth to peace, prosperity, and safety from the apocalypse."
523,The Quiet Earth,"John Hobson is a geneticist involved in a project concerned with manipulating DNA. He awakes in his hotel room in Thames, New Zealand after a nightmare of falling from a great height. Upon getting up he finds the electricity off. It is quiet outside, with nobody in sight. Hobson checks the time in his car, finding the vehicle's clock is also frozen at 6:12. The town's shops are locked and unattended, with no sign of people. Investigating a car sitting at an intersection, Hobson sees that the driver's seatbelt is still fastened. Telephones are dead and there is only static on the radio. All humans and animals have disappeared. Some force has altered the clocks to show the same time and then stopped them, suggesting an intelligence behind the event, which Hobson dubs 'the Effect' Apirana Maketu, a Māori and a lance-corporal in the New Zealand Army. Api heard the same sound that Hobson heard – albeit earlier in the day and coming from the side of the lake Hobson was standing on. It's present only in certain places, and is stronger at night. The soldier is both relieved and worried to find Hobson has experienced the same dread. The two men seem to share a flash of recognition. Neither can account for this, as they have never encountered each other before. They arrive at the nation's capital to find it devoid of life, and Hobson and Api set up dwellings in a hotel and hunt for survivors. A transceiver is set up for the scientist's studies and he plans to run tests to see if he can determine the nature of the Effect and the reason why he andApi survived. A search of Gisborne and the East Coast yielded nothing, and a visit to the power station at Tokaanu led him to believe the electrical grid was knocked out by a massive surge. The film is set in New Zealand in the 1980s and 1990s. It was released on September 11, 2013. It has been released on Blu-ray, DVD and Blu-Ray, and on DVD on September 14, 2013, and 10th September 2013, respectively. The book is available in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Australian and New Zealand, and in the UK.

524,The Phantom Tollbooth,"Milo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time. He arrives home from school one day to find a mysterious package that contains a miniature tollbooth and a map of ""the Lands Beyond"". Attached is a note, ""FOR MILO, WHO HAS PLENTY OF TIME"". He assembles the tollbooths, takes the map, drives through the toll booth in his toy car, and instantly finds himself on a road to Expectations. He pays no attention to his route and soon becomes lost in the Doldrums, a colorless place where thinking and laughing are not allowed. However, he is found there and rescued by Tock, a ""watchdog"" with an alarm clock attached to him, who joins him on his journey. Their first stop is Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the Kingdom of Wisdom. They visit the word marketplace, where all the world's words and letters are bought and sold. After overcoming various obstacles and their own fears, the questers reach the Castle in the Air, where the two princesses welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. The armies of Wisdom welcome the princesses home, King Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day carnival celebration of the return of Rhyme and Reason, the Princesses of the land.

Milo is somewhat disappointed but finds that the world he lives in is beautiful and interesting. He awakens the next day full of plans to returning to Wisdom, but when he returns from school the Tollbooth has vanished. A new note has arrived, which reads, "" FOR MILO,. WHO NOW KNOWS THE WAY."" Milo is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour. The Humbug appoints Milo as a guide, and he, Milo, and Tock set off for the Matemagician's capital of Digitopolis to obtain his approval for their quest. Along the way they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy who sees through things and grows until he reaches the ground, and have adventures like watching Chroma the Great conduct his orchestra in playing the colors of the sunset. In the Mountains of Ignorance, the three intrepid journeyers contend with lurking, obstructionist demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Senses Taker."
